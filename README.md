# The Art of Working Remotely

This is a static site generated (SSG) web site, using Dan Urbanowicz's eleventy-netlify-boilerplate project as a starting point. Itâ€™s deployed via Netlify. If you want to read more about the process, and to use the boilerplate as a starting point, see [12 Things I Learned After Converting Wordpress Sites to Eleventy](https://scottpdawson.com/convert-wordpress-to-eleventy/) and a detailed tutorial at my Smashing Magazine article: [How To Migrate From WordPress To The Eleventy Static Site Generator](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/12/wordpress-eleventy-static-site-generator/).

This specific project is related to my work as a remote work advocate, and as the author of The Art of Working Remotely.
