**We're going through an unprecedented time.** I've always had a special place in my heart for remote work, having worked remotely since 1998, and I wrote and published The Art of Working Remotely last summer. In light of the worldwide events surrounding COVID-19, and the influx of people having to find their way while working remotely for the first time, I asked myself ... what can I do to help?

**I'm giving away 2/3 of the book as a free PDF, through May 10, 2020.** If you've found yourself thrust into the world of remote work, you're going to find these sections tactically helpful to getting yourself set up and effective while remote. If you're interested in anecdotes and stories that will be additionally helpful to remote workers who are in it for the long haul, [you'll likely appreciate the full copy](/book).

## What's included?

This is not a sample chapter. It's not a preview, or a sneak peek. It's literally two of the three sections of the book, and they'll help you jumpstart your remote work setup, regardless of how long you'll be doing it.

**Section II: The Space** covers the physical aspects of a quality remote workplace. How can you set up an effective work area? What infrastructure will you need? What about office pets? What should you wear? How can you keep from raiding the pantry?

- **Workspace** Your work location and environment is critical to your happiness and productivity
- **Infrastructure** What technology and services will you need to be effective from a remote office?
- **Mobility** Sitting all day long is not good for your health or productivity. How can you move around?
- **Clothing** Wardrobe flexibility is one of the biggest benefits of working remotely
- **Food** Take time for lunch, but beware of the temptation to graze all day long
- **Companions** Office pets can be a staple of a home office and help keep you happy throughout the day

**Section III: The Habits** reviews behaviors and practices that can contribute to remote worker success. How can you manage remote teams and be a good remote employee yourself? What is good communication and how can you promote transparency with what you’re working on? What are the key habits employers are looking for in remote employees?

- **Measurement** Keep track to help plan your marketing, budgeting, time management and focus.
- **Communication** People will judge you based on the quality of your communication, so do it well!
- **Task Management** You’re unique and your workflow is distinctly yours.
- **Managing Remote Teams** Virtual teams are many shapes and sizes. How do you manage remotely?
- **Managing Up** Think you’re not in management? Think again.
- **Discipline** Laundry. Dishes. Floors. Cleaning. Groceries. Discipline takes discipline!
- **Inquisitiveness** Being informed and honest helps you make better decisions.
- **Transparency** When you’re out of sight, try to remove several shreds of doubt as to your productivity.
- **Setting a Course** Don’t be complacent with the status quo. Make a plan!
- **Evolution** Change is inevitable: the important part is how you react to it.
- **Combating Loneliness** How can you counter the effects of loneliness?
- **Get Involved** Getting involved can help counter the isolation you may experience working remotely.
