The comedy duo, [Tripp and Tyler](http://www.trippandtyler.tv/), totally get remote work. Here are a few favorites from their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/trippandtyler).

## Video Conference Calls

Is this what video conference calls are like in your company?

## Audio Conference Calls

Lest you think the video conference callers have all the fun, it's just a good with audio only. I have seen ALL of these in my years of remote work.

## Email

And then there's email. Timeless. Classic. Still just as much fun.
