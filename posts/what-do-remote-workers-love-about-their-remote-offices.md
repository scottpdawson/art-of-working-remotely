One of the benefits of having a remote office is being able to outfit it any way you want. You can choose a room with a view, a room that's quiet, or a room that's colorful. You can put a drum set in there or a few guitars, and you can have your family pet crash with you for the day. When we asked remote workers about the things they've bought that seemed like a splurge, but totally worth it, they didn't hold back. Here are some of the highlights:

- An expensive couch and chair
- Solid desk furniture, and more than a few votes for stand up desks
- A second monitor
- [Herman Miller Setu chair](https://twitter.com/bpmarkowitz/status/997155466512945154)
- Professional paint job on the walls
- A [decent teapot and loose leaf tea](https://twitter.com/breathingpoet/status/852216010581188608), or an [Ember mug](https://twitter.com/scottpdawson/status/996806015084630016) for keeping hot drinks hot
- [High quality headphones](https://twitter.com/laurel_farrer/status/996807066948947968) (and a moderator's vote for Bose noise-canceling headphones)
- [Walking workstation](https://twitter.com/KatherineSliter/status/996806107669594113) 

Of the things that people want, but haven't gotten _yet_, really [great lighting](https://twitter.com/workingrem/status/996803464683372544) seemed to top the list, followed closely by a [standing desk](https://www.autonomous.ai/?is_marketplace=0&category=Standing-Desks-6).
