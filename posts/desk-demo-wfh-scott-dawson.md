This post was inspired by [this tweet from Tammy Bjelland](https://twitter.com/TammyBjelland/status/1263558038503542789) where she showed off her workspace with a 2D tour. Here's my desk demo, the product of 22 years of working remotely.

1. I bought the [**Philips 346B1C UltraWide 34" Curved Monitor**](https://amzn.to/3eYRaxc) to minimize desk clutter. I used to have an iMac and a laptop with external monitor on the same desk. Now, with the Philips' KVM switch, I can use a single keyboard and mouse with my home computer and my work computer.
2. When that decade-old iMac became a little too slow, I upgraded to a [**13-inch MacBook Pro**](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/). Am really happy to have a faster (and portable) rig for nights-and-weekend use. The USB-C connection to the monitor doubles as a power source.
3. The **[Dell Latitude E7470](https://amzn.to/3h1SxNN)** was not my choice: my company provided it for me, and I connect to our company's VPN to work during the day. It's nice to have the second screen off to the right for my calendar, while my main work is on the Philips in front of me.
4. I bought the [**Logitech C270 Webcam**](https://amzn.to/2BFJOAz) in 2013, just after switching jobs and seeing that some people were using video in WebEx meetings. It took five more years for video to become prevalent in my team's culture, but now that it has, this camera still performs flawlessly.
5. I adore my [**Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk**](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html) from fully.com. It's so nice to be able to stand at times, with my laptops and monitor all at a comfortable height. The desk has a smooth lift operation, and I love the bamboo surface.
6. I won the **[Rain Design 10032 mStand Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Rain-Design-mStand-Laptop-Patented/dp/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=lunchtaker-20&linkId=c6a2b68f691a843ea63d6ec4d106bfd6&language=en_US)** in a Twitter contest, and really love it. You only need one close call spilling a coffee on your laptop to realize the importance of something like this. And, it elevates it to a a nice height, too!
7. I bought the **[Ember Smart Mug](https://amzn.to/3eVvYIx)** when it first came out, and we just bought another one for my wife to enjoy her hot drinks, too. It's fantastic to have every sip of my morning coffee be the proper temperature!
8. This **ceramic lizard** is a personal touch with a story. It's a souvenir from a trip to Moab, Utah that we won from Men's Health magazine. This little guy reminds of that happy weekend trip, and how important experiences can be.
9. The **[Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones](https://amzn.to/3gZMnxG)** are the second-most important defense for staying in flow, behind my door as the primary defense. I don't like to close my door, truth be told. These are also great for conference calls, because the sound isn't going _directly_ in your ear (looking at you, earbuds).
10. The **[Logitech M705 Marathon Wireless Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TG75EG)** and **[Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad](https://amzn.to/3eXHRxO)** are a really good combination for me. I used to have wrist pain before I used a gel mouse pad. The wireless mouse is great for travel, too!
11. These **homemade magnetic boards** were fun to make, and more fun to host pictures of my family and other papers. They were simple enough to make: wood trays from a craft store, glue, and plenty of beer bottle caps.
12. My daughter fell in love with making pottery in high school, and now she's continuing to make more as she's in college ([**Pottery by Elizabeth**](https://www.instagram.com/pottery_by_elizabeth/)). I store my pens and pencils in an early piece she made.
13. Yes, that's a **[Bluetooth Banana Phone](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/bluetooth-banana-phone)**. It's a gag that's good for one-time use with a new team, but oh-so-much-fun. The call quality is pretty good, too!
14. The bookshelf is a great place for more personal effects. There's a good luck charm that my sister in law gave me, and a **[mini Lego City set](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22lego+city%22&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)** that I can't bear to take apart.
15. I love my **[Funko](https://www.funko.com/)** characters. These guys all keep watch over me as I work: **[Doc Brown](https://amzn.to/37as6Rw)** _(he says "Great Scott! all the time)_, **[Jack Sparrow](https://amzn.to/2MAWE5e)** _(uses wit and negotiation to get by)_, **[Rick Grimes](https://amzn.to/2z6xkkq)** _(doesn't take any bulls$!t)_, **[Grumpy](https://amzn.to/3dCLCIA)** _(because we all have those days, right?)_, and **[Mickey as Steamboat Willie](https://amzn.to/2MDtkuM)** _(because we all start somewhere)_.

**Want to share yours?** I'd love to cultivate a list of inspired workspaces here, so send me a DM [@workingrem](https://twitter.com/workingrem) with a link to your desk demo!
