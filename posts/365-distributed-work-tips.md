I'll be publishing a helpful work or life-related tip every day in 2021. By the end of the year, it should be rather impressive to look back at 365 (hopefully inspiring) pieces of advice. They'll be related in some way to success at work or life, with a distinct leaning toward thriving in a distributed workplace. 

The [very first one](/365-distributed-work-tips/january/1/) is directly related to this very goal, and is all about taking that first, crucial step, no matter your goal. If you want to follow along, you can [access all of the tips on Twitter using the #365DistributedWorkTips hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23365DistributedWorkTips)%20(from%3Aworkingrem)%20until%3A2021-12-31%20since%3A2021-01-01&src=typed_query&f=live).

I look forward to you sharing your reactions to these goals on social media! If you have a goal you'd like to share, [please feel free to contact me](/contact/)!
