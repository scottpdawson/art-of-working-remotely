I published a helpful work- or life-related tip every day in 2021. By the end of the year, it was impressive to look back at 365 pieces of advice! They're all related in some way to success at work or life, with a distinct leaning toward thriving in a distributed workplace.

The [very first one](/365-distributed-work-tips/2021/january/1/) was directly related to this very goal, and is all about taking that first, crucial step, no matter your goal. You can [access all of the tips on Twitter using the #365DistributedWorkTips hashtag](<https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23365DistributedWorkTips)%20(from%3Aworkingrem)%20until%3A2021-12-31%20since%3A2021-01-01&src=typed_query&f=live>), but an even better way to consume them is in the published format: [Scott Dawson's Handbook for the Modern Worker](https://scottpdawson.com/writing/handbook/).
