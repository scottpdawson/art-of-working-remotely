There are just 5 [#RemoteChat](/remotechat/) opportunities left in 2020, culminating in our **200th chat** on December 30. To mark the occasion, I'm gifting an autographed hardcopy of [The Art of Working Remotely](/book/) to 5 people, along with a remote work sticker or sticker sheet.

**Want in?** There are a few ways to enter: 

Each of these gives you an entry in the random drawing: 

1. Participate (answer at least one question) in one of December's [#RemoteChat](/remotechat/) sessions. Hit all five? _Sweet._ That's five entries.

2. [Retweet this tweet](https://twitter.com/workingrem/status/1332343757455364098) with your answer to the questions it asks:

3. Invite a friend to one of December's [#RemoteChat](/remotechat/) sessions. Tag your friend, tell them why they'd love the chat, and tag @workingrem. You can do this one as many times as you like.

4. Share a picture of you holding a copy of The Art of Working Remotely, on any social platform, along with your favorite part of the book. If you get another copy, I'll send it to whoever you'd like to gift it to. Send a link to your shared post/tweet to [scott@artofworkingremotely.com](scott@artofworkingremotely.com).

I'll announce the recipients on December 31. _Good luck!_
