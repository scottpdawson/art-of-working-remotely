Public Wi-Fi can be a boon for hackers. If your work computer doesn’t already leverage a VPN, secure one for cases when you’re working on public Wi-Fi, or working on material that’s internal use only from your home network. When a VPN is on, anyone who’s on the same network can’t see what you’re up to. All of the data that’s sent over the network while you’re connected to the VPN will be encrypted, and therefore unreadable.
