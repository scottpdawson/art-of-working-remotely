description: "We, not I."

Unless you’re on your own as an entrepreneur, work is not a solo effort. You’re likely part of a team, and when you present your team’s work to others, represent the work as a team effort. Use “we” to describe what you’ve done, not “I”. We did this, we did that, and next we plan on doing another thing.
