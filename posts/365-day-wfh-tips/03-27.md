People love to have their opinions and feelings considered when a choice is being made. When you take the time to involve others in your analysis and decision-making, you give them a stake in the outcome and make them feel empowered. That said, if you've already made your decision, don't give others the impression that their input will be considered. Just state your rationale, make the decision, and move on. Anything else will be seen as disingenuous.
