description: "Organize your thoughts when writing something complex."
---

When writing something important, make sure that the structure of what you’re communicating is right. If it’s something that’s taken you awhile to conclude on your own, think about all of the data and logic that helped you arrive at that conclusion. Structure your writing with the goal of influencing the reader the same way. You can tell when something has been organized this way: it doesn’t meander; it is well thought out; it carves a neat path from the beginning to the end.
