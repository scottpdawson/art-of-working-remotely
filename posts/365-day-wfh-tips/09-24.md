The only venues with rational expectations of synchronous communication are phone calls, video chats, or a scheduled meeting. When you ask for something in an asynchronous medium like chat, email, or another collaboration tool, resist the temptation to expect an immediate response. Your message should be clear and concise. If you have a deadline in mind, cite that. Then, know that the recipient will respond at a time convenient for them.
