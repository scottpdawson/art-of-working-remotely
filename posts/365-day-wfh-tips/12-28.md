It can be easy to keep your head down and stay focused on your core mission. However, it’s invaluable to poke your head up periodically and take stock of where you fit in the grander scheme. Proactively reach out to others. Learn about what they’re working on, what their challenges are, and find out about their lives. This will help you counter feeling isolated or disconnected. You’ll see how your work fits into a broader theme and direction, appreciate what others are doing, and see how your work connects with theirs.
