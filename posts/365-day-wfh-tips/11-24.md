There are so many options for sitting while working: a simple no-frills chair, office chair, executive chair, mesh chair, inflatable ball, kneeling chair, reclining chair, saddle chair … the list goes on! In short, you need a comfortable seat that gives you good support and promotes good posture. Test drive whatever you’re considering and make sure features you need (armrests, adjustability, proper height adjustments, lumbar support) are all there.
