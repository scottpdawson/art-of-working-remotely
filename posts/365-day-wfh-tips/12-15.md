When something impacts you negatively, it’s natural to see the force behind the impact as having negative intentions. It can be so difficult to look instead for positive (or at least, neutral) intent. Seek first to understand the bigger picture and the broader situation. You might discover something that hadn’t factored into your knee-jerk negative reaction. Of course, you may find that there indeed was negative intent, but that’s going to be the exception, not the rule.
