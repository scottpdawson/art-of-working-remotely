Don’t let your email manage you. There are many approaches to email management, so find one that works for you. You know it’s working when you don’t have to apologize for not seeing something important, or not holding up something that you’ve been asked to weigh in on. There are many benefits to keeping conversations in collaboration platforms instead of email, so over time, you may find a decreased reliance on email and an increased reliance on consistent use of collaboration software. While we’re in email-land, though, use rules, labels, notifications, and folders to your advantage.
