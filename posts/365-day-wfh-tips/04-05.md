If you are granted paid time off as a term of your employment, use it. If you're a solo practitioner, make the time to take time away. When you feel the need to recharge throughout the year, take time off to do so. It might be a few days here and there, or a solid stretch of weeks to truly disconnect. Powering through seldom works out well and can lead to burnout. So, take the time to smell those roses. Your work will be waiting for you when you're done!
