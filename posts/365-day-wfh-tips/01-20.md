Whether it's part of your normal work responsibilities or after-hours "extra credit" time, seek out new challenge to open new professional pathways. Express interest in a new project at work. Try out a new technology or skill with online or real-life learning. It's a simple cause-and-effect: when you challenge yourself, you grow.
