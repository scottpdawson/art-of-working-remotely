If you don’t need to actively participate (much, or at all) in a meeting and your face won’t be missed in a video meeting, try ditching the anchor at your desk and go do something else while you listen in. Light chores, outdoor walks, or light indoor fitness (elliptical, bike, rowing) are all fair game for getting something else done while you focus on what’s being said in the meeting.
