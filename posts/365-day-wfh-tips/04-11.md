We spent a lot of time looking at screens of all shapes and sizes. If you’re feeling the effects of eye strain, check out the 20-20-20 rule. It’s a simple one: for every 20 minutes of screen time, take a break to look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Some other ideas for reducing eye strain: wear blue light glasses (though there’s no research to support this yet) and make sure you visit an optometrist regularly to check your vision and gauge the health of your eyes.
