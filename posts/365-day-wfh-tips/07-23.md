Have you been exposed to insults, harassment, or bullying while you’re on the job? Have you been a witness to this behavior, or had someone who worked for you report it? Don’t keep it to yourself. Documentation is your friend. Carefully and objectively document the behavior you’ve seen and keep everything in a secure place. If the incident is a one-off you can try to sort it out person-to-person. If it’s a pattern, though, it’s time to get HR involved to chart an appropriate course.
