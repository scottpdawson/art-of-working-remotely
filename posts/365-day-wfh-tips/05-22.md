Do you want to learn a new language, skill, or have an idea for a project? Just get started. Take the initiative to get them done during nights and weekends. These types of projects can be a great way to learn something new, put it into practice on your own schedule, and demonstrate to current or potential employers that you're totally into lifelong learning.
