If you’re interested in being promoted or being recognized with raises and bonuses, you need to have people in “the room where it happens” who will advocate for you. People who know the value of your work and have a vested interest in your career success. A sponsor is not a mentor. They’re an advocate. They might be your manager, but also more senior leaders or your manager’s peers. Cultivate those relationships and be transparent about your goals and aspirations. Once people know what you’re after career-wise — and respect and value the work you do — they’ll help you get there.
