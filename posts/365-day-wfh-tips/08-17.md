Joining a group outside of work can help you feel socially and emotionally fulfilled. Youâ€™ll find them centered around religion, hobbies, or sports. Community volunteerism with your local school, library, food pantry, Habitat for Humanity chapter, or fire department can also fit the bill. As a side benefit, these activities can feed back into your professional life. People you meet in non-professional circles might need the freelance or consulting services you can offer, or they may know someone who can use your skills.
