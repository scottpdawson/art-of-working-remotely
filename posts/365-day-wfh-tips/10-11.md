Discipline isn’t just about avoiding things that suck productivity from your day. It’s also about ensuring you do the things that enrich your life and bring you joy. Try to cultivate habits around wellness-related activities that bring you relief from the stresses and pressures of work and responsibility. When you make fitness, music, reading, fellowship, learning, or a hobby a habit, it’ll inject some balance into your day that you can look forward to.
