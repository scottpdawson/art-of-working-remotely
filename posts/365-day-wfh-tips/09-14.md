There are very few occurrences where you have to do something immediately. If you feel like you should start a new project, buy the hottest new toy, or digest the latest must-read blog post, article, or book … just write it down first in a list. Come back to it later and see if it’s still important to you. You’ll find that most of what’s on your list just isn’t that important anymore.
