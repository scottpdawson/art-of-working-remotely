Working remotely is inherently a solitary activity. It doesn't mean you have to go it alone, though. You may be uncertain about something and need counsel. You may feel isolated and need companionship. You may have great news and want to share it. Whatever it is, don't keep it to yourself. Nobody goes very far when they're traveling alone. We can all get by with a little help from our friends.
