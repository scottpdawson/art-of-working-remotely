description: "Ensure stability in your audio connection."

We can all do without video if needed, but if audio fails it’s a big problem. If you’ll be talking a lot in a meeting, ensure that you’re using the most stable audio connection possible. If you’re in a place with great bandwidth, use the streaming options you may normally use on your device. Otherwise, connect over a landline or your cell phone so you’ll be less likely to experience audio issues. Also, always be prepared to switch your connection if your primary way of connecting fails (Wi-Fi, for example).
