description: "Validate your team."

You’ve just been called out for doing a good job. Feels good, right? When you take time to recognize and validate what your team has done, you boost their esteem, increase job satisfaction, and motivate them to repeat the feat. It has the opposite effect when you don’t recognize these efforts with sincere thanks. Validation doesn’t have to cost much — or anything, for that matter — just a simple expression of “Wow, you took on a tough task and hit it out of the park” can do nicely. Simple rewards like concierge coupons, a virtual pizza party, or a token gift can also be great ways to recognize significant achievements.
