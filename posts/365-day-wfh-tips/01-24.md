You know that moment, when you're totally stuck and don't know how to proceed? It's frustrating. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone for a midday run, walk, or hike, and come up with the solution to a problem in the first 10 minutes. Next time you're stuck, get up and so something else. It might be the thing that gets you going again.
