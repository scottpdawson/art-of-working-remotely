It’s good to disconnect periodically. Spend time away from your computer or devices each week. It might be a hike where you leave it all behind, socializing with family or friends, or finding a corner to quietly read. You’ll appreciate the focus you can have when the lure of social media, personal or work email, or push notifications can’t reach you. Give it a few hours and see how it goes. Get up to a full day and you’ll be ninja-level.
