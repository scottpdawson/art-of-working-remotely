It’s time to buy a new computer. Think first and foremost about the physical size you need. Is portability a concern? It is if you ever want to relocate to another spot to work. Get the size that’ll work for you. Then, if your budget supports it, get a configuration that’s slightly better than what you think you need. It’s hard (or impossible) to upgrade processor speed, RAM, or disk space, so consider these up-front incremental costs as a way to delay a future upgrade.
