Where do you sit or stand when you work? One of the benefits of distributed work is that you don't always have to work in the same space. You will find, however, that you spend most of your time in one area. Consider the view outside, your desk and chair, lighting, wall colors, and what you surround yourself with. Create a space that delights you!
