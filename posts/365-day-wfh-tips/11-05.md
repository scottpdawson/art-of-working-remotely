Think about inclusiveness when it comes to remote members of your hybrid team. Going out for a team lunch? Do something similar for remote members and invite them to go out for lunch on you. Or, have your onsite team enjoy a lunch in the office and arrange to have similar fare delivered to your remote colleagues. Pizza parties for everyone!
