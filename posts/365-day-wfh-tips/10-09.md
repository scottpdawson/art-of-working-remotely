description: "Know when you’re not needed."

Think you have to attend a meeting just because it’s on your calendar? Think again. This is especially true for recurring meetings where you’re copied as an interested party. You know the meetings where sometimes you’ll be needed, but most of the time you’re not? Skip them. Be transparent with the organizer, and make sure they know you’re available if they need to call on you in a given week. When you schedule meetings, think about who’s necessary and who’s optional, indicating the distinction in the software if it supports it.
