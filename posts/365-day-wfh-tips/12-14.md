Well, other exercise counts, too. Since exercise has such great physical and psychological benefits, incorporate it into your day. You’d be spending some time commuting before and after work if you were going to a separate office, so why not use some of that bookend time to get some steps in? You may be starting and ending in the same place, but it’s still a commute. Plus, that buffer time can provide nice mental separation from work and non-work modes.
