description: "Listen at least as much as you talk."
---

Set a goal to listen to others in a meeting or conversation just as much, if not more, than you talk. You can learn so much more, and often arrive at a better conclusion, than if you dominated the conversation. After all, if you're doing all the talking, the interaction could have been an asynchronous communication. Make sure that everyone has a voice, too. A simple prompt of "What do you think?" can bring a quieter person into center stage and give you additional insights.
