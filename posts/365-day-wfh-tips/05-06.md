Multitasking is the mother of all distractions. Your attention is pulled from task to task, and both tasks can suffer. One tactic can help tame your tendency to multitask: get rid of distractions and commit to completing one task before switching to another. Better yet, promise yourself a "reward" when you're done. When you've promised yourself something on completion - a walk, a quick errand, or a much-needed refill of your coffee - you'll be more likely to stay on track.
