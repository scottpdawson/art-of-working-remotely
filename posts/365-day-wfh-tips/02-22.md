Tempting snacks can be as close and available as you want them to be when you're working from home. Don't let the proximity of your fridge and pantry derail your day. Plan ahead to help keep your nutrition in check: what will you have for lunch? What will your snacks be? When will you eat them? Knowing this can help prevent grazing when stress comes knocking on your door.
