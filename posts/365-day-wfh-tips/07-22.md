description: "Decline appointments when you’ll be out."

It’s no fun to get to a meeting and realize that key participants are not there because they failed to notify the meeting organizer. When you’ll be out for vacation, holiday, a personal day, or sick time, add an all-day appointment to your calendar and mark your status as out of office. Decline any appointments where you’ll be missed.
