Business is about relationships. In relationships, candor is key. If you have something to say, don't "beat around the bush" and hope that your message will be received. This is especially important when you have someone difficult to communicate. It's never a license to be rude or caustic, though. Balance your openness and honesty with tact and sensitivity.
