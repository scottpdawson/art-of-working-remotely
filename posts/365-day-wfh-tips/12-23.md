This popular personal finance phrase applies no matter where you work. Reserve a certain amount of every paycheck or invoice paid and apply it automatically to a specific goal. You’ll be amazed at how quickly you can amass the money you need for your goal. Whether it’s for a house, a car, or a vacation, it can be incredibly effective to reserve funds before you use them for routine or discretionary purposes. Bonus points if you do this via direct deposit, and the money never makes it into your normal accounts.
