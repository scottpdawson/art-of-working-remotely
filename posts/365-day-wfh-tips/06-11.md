You’re about to summarize your key point in a very important meeting when disaster strikes: your spouse, roommate, child, or pet (or any combination, frankly) bursts into the room, interrupts your flow, and calls attendees’ attention away from you. This happens every day, but it doesn’t have to. Communicate your “do not disturb” status with those around you with a shared calendar, a conversation, or a sign or indicator on the closed (and locked, if possible) door.
