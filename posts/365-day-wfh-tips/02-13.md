It's a virtual world. You're either present or absent in a meeting. There's no such thing as 'they're almost here, they're in the hallway.' So, be on time for meetings that you're participating in. Moderating a meeting? Be a few minutes early. Doing a demo or a presentation to a large group? Be ready five to ten minutes early. Going to be late? Let someone know.
