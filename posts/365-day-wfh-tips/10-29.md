Think about the goal of your communication. Are you in the midst of a conflict? Are you communicating with someone who might take offense at what you have to say? Is persuasion your ultimate goal? The words you choose and the tone you deploy them with are critical to effective delivery of your message. Think about how others might perceive what youâ€™re going to say. A gentle tone can keep others from becoming defensive in the moment.
