Set a goal to meet someone new every so often. It might be weekly, monthly ... whatever frequency you're comfortable with. Then, do something social with them! The person you meet would ideally be new, but you can also rekindle a business or personal relationship you've had in the past. This is a great way to expand your network and keep it healthy.
