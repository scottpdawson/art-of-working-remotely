When you're not in a physical space together, you lack the ability to have someone stop by your office and see what's in progress, or check out the wall of notes in the conference room. That means you have to be far more intentional about sharing your team's achievements. Some ideas: a simple targeted email at the end of a project, a newsletter that's sent on a set schedule, or an internal website dedicated to project-level sharing. You can also host virtual events - roadshows, if you will - to share synchronously.
