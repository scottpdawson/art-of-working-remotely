description: "Warm up your emails."

When you write emails, you might be inadvertently using a less friendly style than you intended. Go back and look at your correspondence. Is it coming off the way you’d hoped? Written words don’t have the tone and texture that spoken do, so you have to be intentional about warming up your emails. For suggestions, search for “warm tone in emails”.
