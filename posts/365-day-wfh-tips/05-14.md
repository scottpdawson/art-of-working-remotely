You’ll have many opportunities to speak to audiences large and small, virtually and in-person, during your career. If you’re not comfortable with public speaking — and let’s face it, if you’re not in front of a mirror by yourself, it’s public speaking — take a course or two to get more comfortable. A few heuristics: speak more slowly and deliberately than you think you should; enunciate; vary your tone and cadence (no monotone delivery); make eye contact; move around if you can; and have fun with it!
