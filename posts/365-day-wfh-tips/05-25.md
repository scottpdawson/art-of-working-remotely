description: "Overcome distance bias."

Distance bias is the tendency to favor people who are closer to us in time and space. As a remote worker, you'll experience this at some point in your career. Counter it by taking time one-on-one time with your manager to review your recent accomplishments, development goals, and future plans. As a manager, you can help your remote employees transcend distance bias by ceding the spotlight to them in presentations, demos, and other public forums, and by being inclusive of their opinions when making decisions in a hybrid setting.
