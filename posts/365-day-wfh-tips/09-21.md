Did you just have a meeting where some key things were decided? Does someone need to follow up on next steps? In the moment — or better yet, in advance — assign someone to document the decisions and action items in a persistent place. Don’t leave things to chance or rely on your memory. By being explicit about who’s doing what and what decisions were reached, you’ll avoid confusion down the road.
