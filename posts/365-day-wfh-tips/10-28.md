description: "Practice Pomodoro for productivity."
---

The Pomodoro technique can help you stay focused on a task, but also ensure that you take periodic breaks as you work. Developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, the technique has you work on a task for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break. After four of these, take a longer break. Too rigid for your tastes? Try using a timer and varying the intervals to suit your schedule. The ultimate goal is to provide a focused environment to work on a single task during your best productivity time.
