Distributed work is especially conducive to creating a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) but it takes work to get it right. Your company may not offer explicit benefits to nurture this culture, but as a manager you can make it clear to your team that you’re open to everyone’s needs. We’re all different but we strive to be welcomed and valued in a group. Be open about supporting differences while embracing your core team’s mission.
