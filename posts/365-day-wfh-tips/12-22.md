If you stand at all during the workday, try using an anti-fatigue mat. Studies show significant benefits to using them. They take the strain off your muscles, provide stability, reduce joint compression, and improve circulation. Your body will enjoy minor movements while you shift your position from side to side or front to back. Choose a highly-rated textured mat with contours that will get you moving while standing.
