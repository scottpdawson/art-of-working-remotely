You'll set so many courses in life. Your career. Where to live. How to invest your time. Choosing who you surround yourself with. If you find you have to course-correct during your journey, that’s life. You’re the captain of your ship, so your direction is ultimately up to you. You might need to consult and consider others (hello, family), but at the end of the day, make choices for yourself.
