If you rely on heroics to get your job done, you're doing it wrong. Whether it's relying on a star performer, burning the candle at both ends, or constantly asking your team to do more with less, heroics are not a sustainable business strategy. If you feel like you're the hero, remember that success is bigger than yourself. Success takes healthy relationships, strategic partnerships, and effective communication. Put your focus there and you'll all grow together.
