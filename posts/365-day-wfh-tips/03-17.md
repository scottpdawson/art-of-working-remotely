Whether you're a manager or an individual contributor, recognize that siloed information only benefits the owner of that information. If you find something useful, chances are others will, too. Procedural knowledget can help others follow steps to an intended outcome. Contextual information can help someone understand why what they're doing is important. Share this information through persistent means: email is okay, but a wiki or online knowledge base is so much better. Make it clear, concise, and easily findable. Your future self, and your fellow workers, will appreciate it.
