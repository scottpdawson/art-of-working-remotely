Whether you're a manager or an individual contributor, recognize that siloed information only benefits the owner of that information. If you find something useful, chances are others will, too. Share knowledge through persistent means. Email is okay, but a wiki or online knowledge base is so much better. Make it clear, concise, and easily findable. Your future self, and your fellow workers, will appreciate it.
