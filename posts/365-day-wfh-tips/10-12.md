You might be a pro at using the latest software or tool, but unless you can demonstrate solid soft skills (communication, problem solving, collaboration) and a growth mindset (you can learn something new), you’ll be at a disadvantage when it comes time to find a job. You’ll be ahead of the pack if you can prove you’re a quick study. Can you think on your feet? Do you know how to use your resources to solve problems? Can you learn on the job? That will set you apart.
