Artificial intelligence doesn’t run the world yet, which means that you’ll likely find a person behind every process. Whether it’s resolving a support ticket, getting help with your hardware, or resolving a customer service issue, remember there’s someone like you on the other end. Imbue your interactions with a dose of humanity and understanding. You never know where or when your paths will cross again.
