How many hours do you sit each day? Sitting all day long can be bad for your health, so try to find ways to stand throughout the day. Set a timer to remind yourself to get up every half hour to move around. Standing desks can help you adjust your position throughout the day, too. Taking meetings while walking (bonus points if it's nice outside) can be a great way to log non-sitting time.
