There’s nothing worse for security than using the same password for a lot of web sites and applications. Instead, turn to a password manager where you can use more secure passwords and have them auto-fill when you’re prompted for credentials. Password managers will typically sync between your devices and computers, too, so you can always have passwords when you need them. Just be sure to choose a secure master password that you won’t forget. For an additional layer of security for really critical applications, turn on two-factor authentication.
