Negative addictions have no place in your nine-to-five. It's your choice to have them in your non-work time, though. Whether you're addicted to the latest binge-worthy show on Netflix, or a game that's engineered to have you playing for hours, you'll be more productive and happier if you can't access it when you're working. Put up a firewall, use parental controls for yourself, or just get rid of whatever stands in the way of you and rampant productivity.
