You can go all in and include probiotics and antioxidant-rich foods in your diet. Or you can simply opt to “eat a rainbow”, focusing mainly on whole foods. If it comes in a bag or a box, or if the ingredients list has more unpronounceable things than you can shake a stick at, it’s probably not as good for you as something from the produce aisle. Depending on where you live, a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) farm may be an option for fresh produce most weeks of the year. No matter your culinary preferences, remember that variety is good and moderation is even better.
