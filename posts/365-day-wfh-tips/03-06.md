How well do you know the other people you work with? When you interact only around work, you miss part of the picture. Schedule a recurring agenda-free time to meet as a group. When you give yourself this permission to be with others without a specific business problem to solve (or status to update), you'll get to know each other so much better. This closer connection, in turn, will help ease  business-oriented interactions.
