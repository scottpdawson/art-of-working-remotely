We all have biases. Theyâ€™re part of our natural circuitry and are typically unconscious stereotypes. In a professional environment, the key is to recognize them and take steps to avoid or mitigate them. Ageism, sexism, and racism are all rooted in unconscious bias and are toxic to a safe, effective workplace. Other biases abound, too. Look for professional development opportunities to be able to recognize and address bias in your workplace.
