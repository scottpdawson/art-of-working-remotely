Software updates are important. They protect your computer and your phone from security vulnerabilities, fix bugs, and provide new enhancements that can help your productivity. To mitigate the stress of an update - especially a major one - make sure you have a backup of your computer or phone before you start. Don't install updates as soon as they're available: wait a few days in case the provider gets feedback that they need to release an update to the update to address any upgrade problems.
