Make a space where your team can share with each other. As we all learned in kindergarten, “sharing is caring.” It’s important to share things outside of your core work deliverables so it’s not just another status meeting. Share something you heard or saw, something you created outside of work, or something you learned that’ll help others in the pursuit of their goals. Aim to have your sharing be inspirational, novel, and unique.
