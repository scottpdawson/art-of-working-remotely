description: "Tell the story you want to be heard."

March 11, or 311, has me thinking about how we portray ourselves online. After all, 311 is a non-emergency phone number you can typically call in many big cities to get information. When you're distributed, online channels are the primary way others can learn about you. What do they see? It's worth the time to think about your personal brand. How does that come through in your personal web site, what you blog about, or how you appear on social media? You don't have to play in all these sandboxes, but if you do, invest the time in making sure the story that's told is the one you want to be heard.
