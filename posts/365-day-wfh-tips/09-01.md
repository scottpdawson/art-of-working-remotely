It’s a fantastic icebreaker question to open the door to conversation about your career trajectory. When you know the answer to this question, you can start to take steps to get closer to your goal of doing the work you actually want to do, if it differs from the work you’re doing now. If you’re happy where you are, that’s good information to know, too. You can continue to grow and mature in your role, which is good for you and your team.
