When you get a new manager or colleague, roll out the welcome mat for them, just as you had (or hoped you had). Schedule an initial call to say hello, talk about what you do for the team, and how they can best contribute. Take early steps to built rapport by getting to know them as a person, and making sure they know they can turn to you anytime if they have questions or concerns.
