description: "Take time at the end of the road."
---

You finished a big project. It took tons of planning, coordination of many groups, and had its highs and lows. But you’re done. And it’s awesome! There’s a saying: a new adventure awaits at the end of the road. Take some time before embarking on that new adventure. Relish in your accomplishment. Get some white space in your mind to think about what you learned and what you hope to get out of what comes next. New adventures beckon, but they’ll wait for you to take a break to exhale, get some clarity, and reward yourself.
