It’s important to measure things, whether you work for yourself or for a company. Peter Drucker said "you can't manage what you can't measure." Actually, you can’t do a lot of things if you don’t measure them. Keep track to help you plan your marketing, budgeting, and time management. At annual review time, remember that numbers and metrics mean everything to managers. If you’re working for yourself, keeping track of key metrics can help you identify trends, too.
