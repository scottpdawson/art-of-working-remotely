Need to demonstrate your effectiveness to someone, even if that's just you? Take stock of your accomplishments at a set interval: the end of the work week is as good a time as any. Set a recurring reminder in your calendar and document things that are important to you and interested parties. The more quantifiable, the better. Do you have a formal review at the end of the year? Good. Your documentation will be invaluable as you paint a comprehensive picture of your work.
