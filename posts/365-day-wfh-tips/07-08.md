It’s so important to know what good digital security looks like. So many bad actors try to get into your computer and network using email attachments, phishing links in  the body of emails, and social engineering over email, text, or voice. Don’t fall for it. Before you click on a link or attachment from someone you don’t know, check with someone who can tell you for sure, or if there’s even a shred of doubt, just delete it.
