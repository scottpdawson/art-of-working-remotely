Not all business decisions or discussions can be had in the moment. If you have a difficult topic to cover as a group, talk to individuals in advance to get their thoughts. This is an equity play, too: you’ll get input from the quieter and more reserved people on your team. Then, you can approach the topic with a more well-rounded understanding of the broad themes at play. Still not sure? Bounce your ideas off a mentor or someone else whose judgment you trust.
