Flexibility is one of the key benefits of working remotely. Transparency is also important. When you have an appointment that’ll take you out of communication for a stretch during business hours, update your availability in your calendar so others know that you’re out, or at least busy. Don’t be a slave to the green “presence” icon — it’s okay to step away for a break without announcing it, but you owe it to your coworkers and managers for longer stretches of unavailability. You don’t need to announce the minute details of your doctor’s appointment or who you’re enjoying lunch with (don’t overshare), but don’t leave doubts as to your whereabouts.
