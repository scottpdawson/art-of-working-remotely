description: "You have to leave off before you can pick up."

There are times when your work will not logically conclude at the end of your work day. This can be tough if itâ€™s a particularly vexing problem. If you must leave something undone, take steps to be fully present for yourself and those around you during your non-working time. Unburden your mind by leaving notes to yourself about what your immediate next steps are when you pick up where you left off. Make a plan in your calendar to finish the work. Then, leave.
