According to the World Health Organization, burnout is defined as "a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed." Watch for signs of burnout in yourself, or on your team. Signs include feeling exhausted or depleted, disconnection from your work, cynicism, and decreased performance. Do not ignore these signs if you see them. Gallup cites five key causes, and they all have prescriptions for resolution: unfair treatment, unmanageable workload, unclear top-down communication, lack of manager support, and unreasonable deadlines and pressure.
