Your team meetings are a great place to focus on how the group is performing against their goals. They’re the right place to share broad themes like enterprise-wide activities, strategy, and vision. When it comes time to check in individually, though, there’s nothing like a 1:1 meeting. Don’t focus solely on work. Focus on the individual. You’ll learn things you can’t in a group setting because we all act differently one-on-one. How are they feeling about their work? Career trajectory? Emotionally? By dialing into how they're doing as an individual, you'll get more insight and build a stronger relationship.
