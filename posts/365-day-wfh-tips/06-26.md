There’s are several common hiring adages related to this but this tip applies more generally. When you work alongside more experienced people (enter smarter, faster, and better), you in turn become smarter, faster, and better. Don’t be afraid to aspire to their skill or experience level. They did it, and with time, effort, and patience, you can too.
