description: "Set expectations for deferred actions."

When you can’t answer something in the moment, or can’t do something in the moment, set expectations for when you can. Tell them, “I’ll get the answer for you” or “I’ll can do this later for you” and be sure to give them a time frame. This type of caring response, instead of a curt “I don’t know” or “I can’t do that” gives the requester an assurance that they’ll get an answer or action later.
