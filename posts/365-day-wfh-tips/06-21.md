Who are your clients or customers? Whatever you call them, they're the people who'd miss you most if you ceased to do the work you do. Like the age-old saying "straight from the horse's mouth", it's best to get insights and feedback from a source as close as possible to your clients, if not directly from them. Only then can you truly understand if the work you're doing is directly aligned to their needs, or helps solve problems they may not know they have.
