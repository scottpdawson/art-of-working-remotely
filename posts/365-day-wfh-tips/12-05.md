It’s important to stay hydrated throughout your workday. When you’re on your own, it can be hard to remember to get up periodically to stretch and grab a drink. Try keeping a big bottle of water at your desk. Coffee and tea (use moderation if you’re affected by caffeine) are also fine choices. Try to avoid sugar-packed drinks, though, because they can mess with your energy levels.
