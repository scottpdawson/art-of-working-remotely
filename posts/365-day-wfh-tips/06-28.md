If you think your manager or peer might want to know something (emphasis on might), take the opportunity to communicate it to them. Trust your gut on communicating status, priorities, and deadlines: the added transparency contributes to an inclusive environment. Bonus points if you share in a public async forum so everyone can see what youâ€™ve shared at their convenience.
