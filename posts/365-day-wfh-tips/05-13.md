When you’re working away from your primary office location, connect to Wi-Fi hotspots you know and trust. Open networks can be used by hackers so be careful when choosing a network to join. Larger companies like Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, Panera, and McDonald’s have free Wi-Fi locations nationwide. You can also check wififreespot.com or specialty iOS and Android apps that help you find Wi-Fi. When all else fails, see if your cell phone plan supports tethering. It can be a great way to get online in a pinch, but be careful with data usage if you lack an unlimited data plan.
