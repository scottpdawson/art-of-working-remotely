When you're working and living in the same space, the lines between the two modes can become concernedly blurry. It's important to create routines around transitioning from one mode to the other, but it can be equally important to physically relocate. Ideally, you have a dedicated space for work and can leave it behind (ideally, by shutting a door) at the end of the work day. If not, at least have a place where you can put your work-related gear (notebooks, phones, laptops) so they're out of sight when you're done for the day.
