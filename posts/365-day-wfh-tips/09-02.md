description: "Keep your meetings on schedule."

Are your meetings chronically running over their allotted time? If you ask if people can “go over” you’re not likely to get totally honest answers. They might be technically able to stretch into overtime, but will they be happy about it? Probably not. Some may also simply defer to the most senior people on the call, too. Respect people’s time and keep your meetings to their allocated slot. Tighten the agenda, don’t let others derail the conversation, and start on time.
