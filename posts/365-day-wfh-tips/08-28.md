description: "Try to be unambiguous when you communicate."

You can head off potential communication issues by trying to be proactive and identify them before they arise. If something can be interpreted more than one way, it's likely that it will be. Read and re-read things when you write them. Make them as clear and concise as possible. If you're writing to someone for whom English is not a primary language, use words that are clear and commonly used, too. Nobody should need to use a dictionary to find out what you really mean.
