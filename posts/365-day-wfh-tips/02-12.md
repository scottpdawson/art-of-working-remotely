Did someone help you get where you are right now? Maybe you're sharing work your team has done by giving a demo, sending an email, or doing a webinar. People love to be recognized for their contributions, so be intentional and share details about who contributed. Better yet, if there's a chance and willingness for someone to step into the limelight and share their own work, make room for that to happen.
