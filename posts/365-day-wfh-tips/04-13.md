If you need to coordinate with others in the same space - with your partner, spouse, or kids - a shared calendar can work wonders to keep you all on the same page. There are so many ways to share depending on the calendar you use. You can share all details, busy/free information, or share just a few calendars that make sense. The added transparency can help you avoid miscommunications and add context to everyone's day.
