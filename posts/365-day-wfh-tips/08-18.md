description: "Create your own community."

What if you can’t find a pre-established group that resonates with you? Create your own. You can use almost any activity as an avenue to creating community. All you need is “the thing” and at least one person to show up. If you’ve already identified a group of people, propose a recurring time to do an activity you love. Try coffee, breakfast or lunch groups; biking, running or hiking groups; touristy things in your area like museums, points of interest, boat rides, wine tastings; game nights with spouses and significant others; group fitness, yoga or pick-up basketball. Even if you haven’t identified a group of people, advertise it and start meeting. Share it on social media, at a meetup, or on a community bulletin board. It may take some time to get traction, but don’t give up!
