Emails and chat notifications inject so much noise in your day. Ruthlessly protect yourself by unsubscribing from emails you never read, and muting or leaving group chats that you don’t need to be a part of. Don’t worry: you’ll get invited back in if you’re missed, and you will know yourself before you hit unsubscribe if you really mean it. Less noise is a good thing.
