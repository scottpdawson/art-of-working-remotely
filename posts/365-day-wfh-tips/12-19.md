description: "Don't mince words."

When you’re following up on something, just ask. Instead of “I’m not sure if you received my email,” try “I’m following up on my email.” When you express doubt with the first phrasing, you make yourself sound insecure and hesitant. Be bold and don’t mince words. Communicate with clarity and confidence, and balance it with tact.
