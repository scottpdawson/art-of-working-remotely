If video conference calls are a part of your day, you might get tired of staring at yourself or others. After all, it's not natural for us to gaze into each other's eyes when we're together in real life. When it gets to be too much, you can do a few things: minimize the video window so you can still see what's being shared (and others can still see you), or simply turn off your video if you want to see others but not yourself. You can still collaborate actively with your voice, and that's just fine.
