Life is sweeter when you can celebrate special occasions as a group. Take note of birthdays, notable work anniversaries, and major life events like an engagement, marriage, or a new child. These are all wonderful reasons to gather virtually and fÃªte your colleagues. For major events, you might take up a collection among team members and present the honoree with a gift card. You can also send around an allowance to allow your team to get a cup of coffee, slice of cake, or some lunch to share as a group as you celebrate.
