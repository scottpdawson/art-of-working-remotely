description: "Build rapport with your team."

You have to rely on voice, video, email, and chat since you’re seldom face-to-face with your team. Use those technologies to establish some rapport. If possible, meet them in person sometime. It’ll ease future interactions if you understand everyone's background. Professional encounters are more effective when you have more insight into their personalities. Talking about a shared experience, especially work-related, is a great way to strengthen a relationship.
