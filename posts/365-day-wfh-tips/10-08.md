Management is like conducting an orchestra. As the conductor, you should know the music (your goals) and the players (your team) inside and out. You should be able to point to a section (oboes, trumpets, percussion) and know what they’re supposed to be doing. However, when a composition could be better, conductors don't abandon their perch. You don't see them rush into a section and start playing along (or worse, replacing a musician). Trust your team to do the right thing and give them the tools to do it. Trust, but verify. Yes, it’s your responsibility to know what’s going on. It's not your responsibility to micromanage, taking creative license and ownership away.
