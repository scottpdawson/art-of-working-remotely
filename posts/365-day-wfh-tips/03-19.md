When you have rigid expectations, you can be sure they'll be derailed. At the end of an ordinary week, think back to the beginning of the week. Did the outcome match your expectations to the letter? Likely not. When you're more flexible about your expectations, you'll be less likely to be disappointed when they're not met. Whether it's shifting timelines, not getting through your task list, or having business deals sour, expect the unexpected. By adjusting your expectations this way, you might create a climate where the unexpected happens a little less often.
