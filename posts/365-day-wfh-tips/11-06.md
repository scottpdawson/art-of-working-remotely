Strive to grow and learn, regardless of your tenure. These opportunities are rarely given to you: you have to seek them out! I’ve rarely been turned down after asking for professional development opportunities. Employers are happy to learn that employees are thirsty for more knowledge. They’ll have a more satisfied employee and you’ll gain new skills you can apply on the job. Opportunities abound with online learning libraries, professional development, conferences, and seminars. Look around and see what you’re interested in!
