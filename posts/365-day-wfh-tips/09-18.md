If you want something, put together a plan to get it. If you don’t plan, you can’t act. If you don’t act, you can’t achieve. Ask yourself: what’s the worst thing that’ll happen if I ask for something I want? Very likely, the worst outcome is that the answer is no. Everything else is better than that, so go for it!
