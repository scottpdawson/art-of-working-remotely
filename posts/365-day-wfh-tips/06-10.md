description: "Don't let personal projects derail your work day."

You might be really into cooking elaborate meals, or take on some complex landscaping, or be in the middle of a multi-day home improvement project. The key is to not let these types of extracurricular activities derail your work day. If you have to spend significant time on these, that's what time off is for. That doesn't mean you can't progress on them and work the same day, though. You lack a commute, so you can spend pre-work time getting something done. Your lunch time is prime time for tackling something that takes under an hour. Just be wary of starting something that you can't finish before you're expected to be at work and productive.
