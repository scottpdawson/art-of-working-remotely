description: "Talk to yourself."

Are you stuck on a problem and would normally reach out to a colleague for help? Try talking to yourself first. The act of speaking through what you know, what's not working, and what you've tried can help spark connections in your brain. When you codify thoughts into speech, you inherently analyze the problem and put things in the proper order. As you talk to yourself, listen closely for the answers. You just might find them.
