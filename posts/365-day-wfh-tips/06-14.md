Deadlines can be a great discipline creator. When you know when something is due, you’re more likely to create the space to get it done. No deadline given? Give yourself one. There’s nothing worse than getting a request to do something “whenever you get a chance.” Make that chance a surety by doing it right then, or adding a date-driven task or calendar appointment for you to do it later.
