If your team is using a collaboration platform for asynchronous collaboration, great! Take it a step further and create dedicated channels to keep similar conversations together. You might align these to projects, themes, or broad initiatives. The important part is to get your team together to discuss and agree on an organization approach that’ll work for everyone. One must-have channel: a casual one where you can share non-project things. It’s fun to be social, but not distract from the focused discussions in other dedicated channels.
