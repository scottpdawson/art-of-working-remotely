You can’t control other people. You just can’t. What you can control is your reaction. That includes whether you react at all! Your work and personal life won’t always be sunshine and roses; you’ll have tough interactions with other people along the way. Remember, in the heat of the moment, that the only thing you can truly control is your own reaction.
