I know, not everyone is champing at the bit to do chores all day long. If they're in your line of sight, though, you might be tempted to tackle them during your work day, and that can be disruptive. Laundy. Dishes. Floors. Cleaning. Groceries. Couple a few of these together and you won't get any work done! The solution is simple: set up a schedule. Each task will have a designated day, so you can take comfort that everything will get done. Just not all today.
