Did you learn something new and want to excel at it? Practice. If you don't have a chance to do it (yet) at your day job, take nights and weekends time to learn, practice, and refine your craft. Promise yourself you'll do it, too, because every day that passes with inaction creates a higher barrier to surmount. Exercise discipline and soon enough, your efforts will pay off and you'll get to apply it on the job, or launch yourself in a new, better direction.
