Conversations can’t all be about the weather, fantasy football, or kids. Open up and talk with colleagues about topics outside of your daily responsibilities. It’ll help strengthen and enrich those relationships. You’ll be a better person and colleague by knowing who they are. What do they like? What are their fears? You'll realize that they, like you, are human. Keep your ears open and listen. You’ll learn a lot.
