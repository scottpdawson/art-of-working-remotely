Multitasking as a productivity measure? It's a myth. When you try to switch between multiple tasks at the same time, you actually reduce productivity and amp up your stress. Instead, try singletasking. You’ll experience less frustration and stress when you commit to doing one thing — and doing it well — before you move on. Maintain an organized task list to help you stay on track.
