You have a great collaboration platform, right? If you use it mostly as an email replacement, for direct person-to-person communication, you’re missing out. Try bringing conversations out into the open, where people can pop in and out of a group as needed. It’s a great transparency move, and nobody will feel as if they’re being left out of the loop. If you do need to meet one-on-one or synchronously as a group, remember to go back and share the results in the collaboration thread.
