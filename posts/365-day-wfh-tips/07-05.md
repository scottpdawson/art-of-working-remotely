description: "Cancel the noise."

There’ll be times when you just can’t tune out the world when you need to. You might be home and the neighbor fires up their leaf blower. Or at the coffee shop and the people nearby are a little too loud. Or trying to be productive while you’re on a bus, train, or plane. When noise intrudes, noise-canceling headphones can come to the rescue. Read reviews carefully and think about what you’d be most comfortable with, either an over-the-ear or in-ear pair.
