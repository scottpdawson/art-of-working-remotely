Work never comes before family. Itâ€™s wonderful to spend more time with your spouse, significant other, children, and extended family as a simple byproduct of working remotely. That said, important events, emergencies, and mini-crises will make this perk all the more critical when they arise. Take the time to fully disengage from work and be with your family, especially when it matters the most. Work can wait.
