description: "Use auto-reply when you'll be away."

Turn on your email auto-reply feature when you’re going to be away from your email. It may be a day, a week, or more, but it’s a great way to let people know that you’re away. Include information about how they can get in touch with you or your designated backup, if that's important. For important communications that you can't follow up on right away, letting people know you received it along with an estimate of when you will get back to them can go a long way toward strengthening communication.
