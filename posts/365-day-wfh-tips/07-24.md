When you communicate something asynchronously, either in email, chat, or in a collaborative document, the recipients don’t have the luxury of real-time interaction with you to clear up ambiguous points. Think about the information that you needed to come to your conclusions and add those to the documentation. Links, screenshots, and other annotations can be critical to comprehension. When you think you’re sharing more than what’s necessary, you’re probably sharing the correct amount of detail.
