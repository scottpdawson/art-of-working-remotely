You know the signs: you’re feeling burned out, uninspired, or chronically stressed in your job. Your career trajectory has plateaued. You’re not getting along with your boss. You’re simply not passionate about your work anymore. Or, the culture has shifted to an uncomfortable place. Remember: you always have a choice: stay or go. If you decide to go, be deliberate, never burn a bridge, and use your network. Think about what you really want and use your feelings as a motivator to effect change. You just might have another opportunity waiting for you!
