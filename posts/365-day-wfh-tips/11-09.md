If you find yourself multitasking in a meeting, it’s a good sign that you might not need to be there. Multitasking typically takes your focus away from the conversation. There’s nothing worse than a huge lead-up to a question for you, and you’re forced to say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I was multitasking.” Don’t be that person. If you must multitask, choose something that’s not mentally taxing so you can remain attentive to the conversation. Try chair yoga, dynamic stretching, or another passive activity like working on a puzzle. You may find you’re able to pay even better attention to the discussion and participate readily when needed.
