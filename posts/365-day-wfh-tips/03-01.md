It might be one of the shortest words that is nearly impossible to say. If you don't feel comfortable with something, or you simply don't have the time for it, say no. This applies to all things personal or professional, and requests big or small. Just say no. There are plenty of guides that'll help you do this politely, without being rude, and without guilt. Search for "how to say no" to get started.
