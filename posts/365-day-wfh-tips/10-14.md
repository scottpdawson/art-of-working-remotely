description: "Never assume a person’s pronouns."
---

When you incorrectly assume someone’s pronouns, they can feel disrespected and excluded. It’s even worse if you do it intentionally, or discount how important it is to do so. Encourage the use of proper pronouns. You might create an environment where it’s routine to have this as part of your email signature where you work. When addressing a group, use a respectful gender-neutral salutation like y’all, everyone, or everybody — not “guys” or “you guys”.
