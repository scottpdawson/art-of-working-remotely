description: "Have fun."
---

We’re not all comedians, but a little appropriate humor goes a long way. We’re all human. When we’re too serious about our jobs and remove the humanity from the equation, it feels like work. When we can have fun while we’re working, we establish more rapport with others and it feels a whole lot better. Have fun with each other!
