description: "Size up your desk."
---

When selecting a desk, think about how much space you'll need for work. Will you need to have space for a larger monitor, external keyboard, and laptop? Where will lighting go? Will you always be doing computer-based work, or will you need some space for other activities like reading, drawing, or writing on paper? All of these considerations will lead to you to an ideal size. If you think you might enjoy standing at any time of the day, consider a standing desk. You'll appreciate the flexibility even if you're only standing for a few hours a day (a mix of sitting and standing is best). Lastly, think about the materials: glass, bamboo, wood, and composite materials all convey a certain feeling when you work at them.
