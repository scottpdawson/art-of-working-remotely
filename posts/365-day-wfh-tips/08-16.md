description: "Take time to introduce new team members."

When your team grows, take some time during all-hands meetings to give them a chance to introduce themselves. It’s a great way to welcome them to the team and get to know them a bit better. Share meaningful pictures, a bit of personal and professional background, and favorite non-work activities. Don’t forget about your existing team members, either. By giving them a periodic spotlight in these gatherings, you help the team to gel even better.
