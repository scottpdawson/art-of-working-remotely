Is the silence deafening where you work? Put on some good music or something soothing to help get you into flow. You have total control over what you hear — or don’t hear — while you’re working remotely. Sometimes you might want to crank up the loudest, bass-filled rock anthem you can find. Other times might call for the purest silence or some ambient noise. You can have it both ways, so experiment with what works and have fun with it.
