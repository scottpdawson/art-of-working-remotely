description: "Dress to impress."

Sure, if you have a meeting where you want to look your very best, do so. But here's some wordplay: on normal days, dress to impress upon yourself the importance and value of work. When you start work wearing what you slept in, you signal the opposite to yourself. You don't have to go all-out with your wardrobe, but be intentional about getting dressed. Ditch the comfortable pajamas and put on something you'd be proud to leave your house in. You'll be camera-ready and your mind will know it's time to work.
