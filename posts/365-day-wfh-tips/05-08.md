When you speak with someone else, it's through a cell phone, a computer, or another device that supports streaming audio. Regardless of the path your voice takes, make sure your voice quality is as good as possible. It’s one of the impressions you make when you’re working remotely. You don’t want to be the person with the horrible voice connection. When you're choosing how to route your voice through these devices and their accessories, think about quality (it varies with Bluetooth accessories and  shock-mounted external mics) and portability. It's nice to be untethered from your desk, but not at the expense of voice quality. Lastly, test your setup with someone you trust.
