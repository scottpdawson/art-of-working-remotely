No, this isn't a tip about going to the movies. It's about monitors! The saying "go big or go home" is not apt when you're talking about monitors. It should be "go big if you're working at home." Think about what your workspace and computer can support. Multiple monitors are great, but wide-screen (some are curved, too) monitors might be in your price range, too. Once you enjoy the ability to have applications side-by-side with ample space, you won't go back to a single smaller screen.
