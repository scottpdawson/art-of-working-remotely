Community doesnâ€™t happen by accident. Sometimes, you have to take the first step in starting a conversation. A smile in a coffee shop. Saying hello in the grocery store. A break to talk to someone working near you at a coworking space. Simply talking to someone can highlight common interests or help them give you an idea of where to find community.
