Regular physical activity can be so important to your health. It can help your concentration, memory, and creativity. Anyone out there want to lower their stress level? Exercise does that, too. Make personal fitness a priority: make a plan to incorporate it into your day. It may be a brisk walk before work, a run or hike between appointments, weight training before dinner, or yoga before bed. Planning in advance will help you keep accountable.
