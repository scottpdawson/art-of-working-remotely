Okay, this is about as uncomfortable as we get with these tips, but this is a topic that any remote worker will know well. If you must visit the loo when you’re on a call, do so. But don’t take your tech with you. If you won’t be missed, turn off your video and audio and simply take your break. If you will be missed, simply say, “Excuse me, I’ll be right back,” and then turn off your video and audio and take you break. As a last resort, if you absolutely must not miss a word (really?) and you do take your tech with you, triple-check that your video is off and that you’re muted.
