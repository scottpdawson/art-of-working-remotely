description: "Compartmentalize."

When you're working remotely, there's no commute to serve as a barrier between your mornings and work, or work and your evenings. When you transition immediately to or from work, stressors can blend from one into the other. Compartmentalization can help ease mental stress, but it can be hard to put into practice. Off the clock? Don't check work email. Hard at work? Save your personal correspondence for later. Try to put systems in place at work (task lists, ample documentation, proper planning) so you're able to free your mind and enjoy time with friends and family during non-work time.
