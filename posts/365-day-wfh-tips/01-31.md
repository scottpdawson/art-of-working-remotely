Don’t settle for a job that has you doing something you’re either not the best at, or not enthusiastic about. When you can leverage your strengths, you’ll be far happier and productive as a worker. If you’re a remote manager, get to know your team members and their strengths. Find opportunities to help them use those strengths daily, even if it ultimately leads them away from your team to another place in your organization.
