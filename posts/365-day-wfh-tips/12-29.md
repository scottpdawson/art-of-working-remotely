If you have someone who’s not a team player, misses deadlines, blames others for their mistakes and constantly gripes about everything, take action. You may fail, but try your best to turn around an underperforming team member. Too many teams are held back by a toxic presence on their team and the manager doesn’t take action. It’s best to address issues head-on within the constraints of what your Human Resources team allows.
