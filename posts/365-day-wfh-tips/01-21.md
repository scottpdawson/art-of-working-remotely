When you're not physically with others on your team, or with your manager, you need to be very intentional about communicating your impact. In a distributed meeting? Great. Contribute, ask questions, and speak up. Did you receive a compliment about your work from someone outside your group? Share it. Does your team use a collaboration platform? Be active, proactive, and helpful there.
