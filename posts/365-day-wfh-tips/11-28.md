description: "Use inclusive language."
---

When you cannot see someone in person, it’s easy to make assumptions about who they are. The problem with assumptions, and the ensuing language you use, is that it can put up relationship barriers. It can make people feel like they’re not a part of the group. Inclusive language comes from not making assumptions about gender, race, personality, sexual orientation, or income levels. Inclusive communication takes practice, but it’s worth it.
