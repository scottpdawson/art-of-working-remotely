You know that feeling when you've been at it for a little too long? It's harder to focus and frustration comes to the fore far sooner than it should. Take some breaks between sprints of work to maximize your mental fitness. Meditation, stretching, physical exercise, a light chore, or a short show can all be great ways to push the reset button when you most need it. These breaks, of course, are a far shorter version of that bigger break that you should also take advantage of: the weekend.
