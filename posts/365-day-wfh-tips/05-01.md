Depending on where you live and the time of year, you might start working as the sun comes up and quit after it gets dark. Think about the task lighting you'll need at your desk, no matter the light outside. Adjustability, aesthetics, color temperature, and illuminance are all factors, so read reviews carefully to find an adequate solution for your situation.
