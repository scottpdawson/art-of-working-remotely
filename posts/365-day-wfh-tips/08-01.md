Are you not getting feedback, or getting feedback that’s not actionable? Ask for it as close as possible to the event that you’d like feedback about. Perhaps you’ve done a presentation, or led a meeting, or finished a big project. Ask others how it went, and what things you could improve upon that would make it go even better the next time. When you take the time to solicit this information, you also send a signal that you care about improvement, which is a good thing for promotion and career development.
