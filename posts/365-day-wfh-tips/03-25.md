description: "Manage up."

If you don’t directly manage anyone, you still have to “manage up” when you’re working remotely. Visibility is so important for promotion, longevity, and satisfaction, but it's tough to be visible when you're remote. You must advocate for yourself. Have an idea? Share it. Do something cool? Share it. Concerned about something? Share it. It's the only way to counter the "out of sight, out of mind" realities that remote work reinforces.
