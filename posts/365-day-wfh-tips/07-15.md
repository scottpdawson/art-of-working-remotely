description: "Avoid groupthink when making decisions."

Be aware of the effects of groupthink when you moderate meetings where you hope to build a true consensus. It can be hard for some people to speak up in a group setting for fear of being perceived differently, or for raising an unpopular opinion or an “out of the box” idea. This can be doubly difficult when strong personalities are in the meeting, and the group’s default tendency can be to adopt the stronger personality’s viewpoint. Haven’t heard from a participant and suspect this dynamic? Ask for their opinion in the meeting, or solicit their feedback in advance. Do your best to cultivate a psychologically safe space where diverse viewpoints can be surfaced and discussed without fear.
