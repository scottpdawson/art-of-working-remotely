An earlier tip covered the importance of keeping your kudos. If nobody gave them, though, thereâ€™d be none to keep. When your colleagues, partners, or clients really shine, take a moment to recognize their efforts. Send them a direct note and copy their manager to let them know just how much of a difference they made. This can extend into non-work activities, too. Reviews make the world go 'round, and if a business has gone above and beyond, give them a boost with a solid review.
