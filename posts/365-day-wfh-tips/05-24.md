What does your health insurance policy cover for mental and behavioral health? As a manager, this is good information to know and share with your team. By being transparent about the availability of these services, you help erase the stigma associated with them. As an employee, if you’re struggling with mental health, do this legwork yourself and see what’s available to you. Even if you have to use your own funds to pay for it, your mental health is just as important, if not more important, than your physical health. Reach out when you need help and take care of yourself.
