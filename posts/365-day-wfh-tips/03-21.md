Ambitious (yet realistic) goal setting is important any time of the year. It’ll help you assess your performance when it's time for annual reviews (if that's something you do), but it’ll also keep you on a solid heading throughout the year. By stating a goal, you breathe life into it. By documenting it and charting a course, you give it hope. By visualizing and working toward it daily, you spur it into existence.
