description: "Be available to your team."

If you're a manager, be available to your team. In a fully-remote or hybrid workplace, this means making an extra effort to convey your availability. Keep your busy/free information up to date in your calendar, and when you're free, be responsive to requests for your time. This will help you generate a track record of availability. Schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with your direct reports, and hold them reliably. Similar guidance applies for team members: by making yourself available and responsive to your peers, you communicate that you're a team player and can be relied on when your skills and counsel are called for.
