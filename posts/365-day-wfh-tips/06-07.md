Nothing hurts an organization's health more than saying, "Well, that's how we've always done it." Time marches on, and with it, the options change for managing yourself, your work, your team, and your business. Evolve to keep on top of your game. Evaluate periodically. Keep what works. Ditch what doesnâ€™t.
