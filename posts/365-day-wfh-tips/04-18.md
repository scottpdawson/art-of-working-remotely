You may be more aware of your hunger when you're working without the distractions of an office. Avoid the temptation to graze throughout the day, opting instead for planned healthy snacks if you need them between meals. Think in advance about what you plan to eat throughout the day and you'll be less likely to reach for unhealthy options. If you have a certain food that's your kryptonite, just leave it off your grocery list. You'll be better off if it's not hollering for you every day.
