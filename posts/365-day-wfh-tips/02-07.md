You don't have all the answers. You don't! You can, however, get them. When you have a tough problem to solve, talk to others who know what you need to know. When you take the time to get perspective and background from others, you'll have far more context to draw on when you moderate a meeting, propose a solution, or weigh in with your advice or opinions.
