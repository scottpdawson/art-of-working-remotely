It can be tempting to let each day slip by, keep your head down, and do good work. That's only part of the recipe for success, though. If you're on a team, either as a manager or individual contributor, make time to connect with those around you. Getting the team together can help share common values and goals. Getting together one-on-one can reveal opportunities for improvement, or reinforce good habits. And meeting with senior leadership can give you or your team the opportunity to shine and be recognized. Find a frequency that works for all, schedule it, and help foster connection.
