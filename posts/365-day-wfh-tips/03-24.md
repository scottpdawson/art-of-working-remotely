Your non-work activities can play a major role in your stress levels, and you bring those right along with you to work. Daily routines can help mitigate feelings of stress. Try going for a walk every morning, eating at similar times throughout the day, and setting (and sticking to) solid times to go to sleep and get up in the morning. Find things that bring you joy, and make a habit of doing them daily. You might find that a solid routine, morning to night, is one thing that blunts the effects of stress.
