description: "Keep a clean office."

In a traditional office, someone else likely vacuums, dusts, collects trash, waters plants, and keeps the fridge clear of aspirational science experiments. Nobody is going to do that for you when you're on your own at home. If you're the exception to this rule, congratulations! So, make a schedule that works for you. Spend a couple minutes every few weeks and you'll maintain a beautiful, dust-free, plant-filled, trash-free space.
