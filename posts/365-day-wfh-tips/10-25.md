description: "Accept praise."
---

When someone tells you you’ve done a good job, or have gone above and beyond, you might feel the tendency to dismiss the praise, deflect it, or minimize it. Don’t do that. You’re a solid worker, and when compliments come your way, accept them like an outfielder catching a pop fly. Confidently, yet humbly, say “thank you.”
