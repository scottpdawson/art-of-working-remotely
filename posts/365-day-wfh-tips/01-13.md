When you’re on video, be aware of what your background says about you. It’s your chance to express your personality, but appropriately so. Art, photos, books, plants, or other personal effects are all fair game. Piles of bills, laundry, or clutter are not. If you must use a virtual background in a bid to hide clutter, go for it. Just be aware that a virtual background can be distracting and can hamper authenticity.
