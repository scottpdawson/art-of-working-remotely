This tip was inspired from Tim Ferriss' interview with Hugh Jackman. Every morning, Hugh writes or types a summary of the day using the past tense as if it's already happened. After using this tip for the greater part of a year, I've come away with three benefits: by putting things out into the universe, using the past tense, you help to manifest them; you can be more prepared for the day ahead by thinking about what it entails; it helps keep you accountable, especially for the tough tasks you say you'll do.
