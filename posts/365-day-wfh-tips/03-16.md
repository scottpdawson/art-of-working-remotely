description: "Schedule with sensitivity."

It's a global world. Increasingly, business is being done asynchronously. If you must have a meeting, though, be sensitive as you craft your invitation list. Find a day and time that respects the boundaries people may have set for themselves - not too early, not too late - and be aware of how varying time zones fit into the equation. Also, invite only who's necessary. There's nothing worse than finding yourself in a meeting that you can't contribute to.
