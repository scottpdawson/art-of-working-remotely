If you are on video calls for any part of your work day, optimize your work space to provide flattering light. Natural light is best, but don't sit facing away from the source. Natural light should be coming from in front of you or off to the side. If you need light sources in the room to illuminate your face better, position them in front of you in a range no greater than 45Â° from where you're facing. Lastly, place your camera at eye level. It's an easier angle to have a more natural interaction with others on the call.
