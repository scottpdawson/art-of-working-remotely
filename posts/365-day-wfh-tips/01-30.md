One of the benefits of working remotely is the ability to put in extra effort when it's needed. If you're on a deadline, are attending to some kind of work-related emergency, or trying to wrap up something you figured out how to do, it can pay great dividends to invest non-work time to getting it done. Flexibility goes both ways.
