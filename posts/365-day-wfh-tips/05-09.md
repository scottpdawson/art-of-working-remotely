Remember the promise of a paperless office? We're almost there! Well, we've been saying that for years, right? Throughout your career, you'll come across the need to move data from here to there, sometimes analog to digital, and sometimes from one format to another. It's worth it to learn the ins and outs of file formats. At minimum, learn how to export a file to a PDF, how to take a screenshot of your entire screen or a region of your screen, and how to create a zip file or an archive of multiple files. When it comes time to digitally deliver something that must be signed, take a high-quality scan of the signed physical paper(s) with your phone (I recommend TurboScan) or use a touch or stylus-sensitive device to mark up the digital version and re-export it as a new version.
