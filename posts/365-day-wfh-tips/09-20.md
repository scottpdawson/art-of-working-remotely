Can you attend an industry conference? You may need to travel but it’s worth it to hear directly from speakers and mingle with like-minded guests. If you cannot attend, some conferences post some of their material online. Try a Meetup, too: they’re smaller local gatherings of people focused on a specific topic. They’re also a great way to meet people, build your network, and reinforce your industry knowledge.
