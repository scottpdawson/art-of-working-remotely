Do you work near other people? Communication can be one of your best tools to create an ideal work environment. If you're giving an important presentation, for example, let others know exactly what you need and when you need it. You'll be grateful for the quiet when the time comes. Signs on your home office door are a great way to let others know when you're busy and free, too. Door hangers, electronic signs, or just simple notes are all fantastic ways to communicate your status.
