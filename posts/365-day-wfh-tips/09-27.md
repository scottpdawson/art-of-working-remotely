Want to ensure that your network connection is consistently fast? Plug into Ethernet. Sure, Wi-Fi that conforms to the newer standards is pretty fast for most tasks, but if you have access to an Ethernet cable connection youâ€™ll get right up to the maximum speed of your connection with the outside world. Plus, file transfers, streaming, and backups between devices that are both hardwired will be far faster than on Wi-Fi.
