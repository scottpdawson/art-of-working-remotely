How are you measuring your team’s output? If it’s by the clock, or as we like to say, time with people in their seats, you’re doing it wrong. Measure your team by their results. This is one of the biggest problems managers have when shifting to a remote work arrangement. They cannot see you, and therefore have no visual assurance that you’re working. To be fair, in an office environment there’s no guarantee you’re actually working when you’re sitting at your desk. How many in-office hours are spent socializing, online shopping, and scrolling through social? When you’re leading a remote team, set the parameters you expect for results and measure those. How your team rises to the challenge is up to them.
