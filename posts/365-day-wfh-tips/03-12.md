It may be tempting to always have your "game face" on at work. However, it's good to share how you're feeling, even if the only byproduct is your own unburdening. It's more likely, though, that you find out you're not alone. Sharing can help unearth trends in how a team is doing. Sharing can help bring more empathy into the workplace. Sharing can lead to change, and change can lead to greater satisfaction and productivity at work.
