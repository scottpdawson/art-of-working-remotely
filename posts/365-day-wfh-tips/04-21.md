description: "Soak, then scrub."
---

Confronted with a stubborn baked-on, burned-on mess? It’s far easier to soak a pot or pan instead of scrubbing for ages. Soak, then scrub. The business analogy: when faced with a difficult problem, compartmentalize it and leave it for a bit. Go for a walk or a run, or work on something different. It’ll still be there when you come back and the answer may come to you in the meantime.
