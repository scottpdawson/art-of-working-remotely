Have you ever talked with someone in person where they’re not quite looking straight at you when you talk? It’s awkward. The same thing can happen when you have a video meeting. Here’s a solution: position your video window at the top center of your screen near your camera. Resize it small enough that when you’re looking at it, it’ll look like you’re looking at your camera. It’s a much more natural interaction for others if you’re looking directly at the camera, and this is the next best thing. This approach is ideal for 1:1 meetings and interviews.
