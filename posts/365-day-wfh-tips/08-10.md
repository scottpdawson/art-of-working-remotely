description: "Tip well."
---

The physical connections you have to your local community are important. When you interact with others, especially in the service industry, provide customary tips for a job well done (or more, for a job extraordinarily well done). Service workers work hard, and anyone whoâ€™s worked in an industry that relies on tips knows the particular value of that currency. This is especially important in the context of a coffee shop where you might work periodically. The baristas will remember your respectful demeanor and treat you accordingly.
