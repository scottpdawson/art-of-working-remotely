Loneliness is one of the most often-cited drawbacks of working on your own. Identifying that emotion and sharing how you feel, first with yourself, is an essential first step to countering it. Put a plan in place to combat loneliness: donâ€™t wait for others to get in touch with you. You get in touch with them: propose a coffee, walk, hike, or a virtual gathering. Don't despair if it doesn't work out the first time you propose something. People can be busy. Try again and be politely persistent in your pursuit of fellowship.
