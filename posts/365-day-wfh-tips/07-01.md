description: "Embrace the midday power nap."

You might experience a lull in your energy levels in the early afternoon. A short power nap - just 15-30 minutes to avoid going into deep sleep - can save your afternoon. There's unfortunately a stigma in some circles around midday napping, but these siestas help reduce stress, improve your cognition, and can position you to have a more efficient afternoon. It sure beats suffering through the afternoon when you're tired, and more prone to slack off doing non-work activities due to your dipping alertness. So set a timer, find a quiet spot, and get a few minutes of midday shut-eye.
