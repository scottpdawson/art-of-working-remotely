When you relocate for a few hours at a coffee shop, a library, or take a longer stint to visit the office or a client site, how do you transport your things? Get a nice “go bag” that’s professional and smart. It should comfortably fit your laptop, devices, mouse, charge cables, wallet, and anything else you need to be comfortable during your time away from your home office.
