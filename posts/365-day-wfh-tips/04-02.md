Think about the data that means the most to you. How redundant is it? Make sure you're at least keeping a backup locally, using an external hard drive. Better yet, add more redundancy by keeping it in the cloud using a service you trust. When you have multiple backups, you'll be far less exposed when hardware fails (and it will).
