Is there something that would improve your ability to get your job done? Ask for it. Some companies offer a budget for this kind of thing, but others don’t. Whether it’s hardware related (computer, keyboard, monitor, or other accessory) or a purchase related to working in your space (desk, anti-fatigue mat, or another ergonomic improvement), you won’t get it if you don’t bring it up. If all else fails, get used to budgeting for and making some purchases on your own. You won’t regret anything that improves your work.
