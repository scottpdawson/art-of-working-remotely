Joy is defined as "a feeling of great pleasure and happiness." I don't know about you, but I don't always correlate my 9-5 with pleasure and happiness. But I certainly don't correlate it with the opposite. If you do, take stock of where you're at in your career. It might be time to refine your goals, do some professional development, or reboot into a totally different industry that'll up your joy factor.
