It's a big world and chances are you'll find yourself working with someone in a different time zone. Scheduling meetings is another topic, but simply being aware of the time where your colleague is located is a great way to deepen connection. Awareness can help you use the proper salutation for the time of day (good morning vs. good afternoon) and be aware of when someone's working earlier or later than they usually do. It's a great conversation starter, too, if it's close to quitting time for your colleague, or close to lunch time. There are so many desktop, mobile, and wrist-based solutions for calculating times across time zones, so pick one and enjoy knowing what time it is at a glance.
