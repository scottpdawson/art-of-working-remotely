It doesn’t have to be a long conversation, or derail the goal of the meeting, but take time to relate to each other as you would in person. Start or end with casual conversation. Is it Friday? Ask about weekend plans. See interesting art in someone’s video background? Ask if there’s a story. Opening the door with conversation can lead to deeper connection.
