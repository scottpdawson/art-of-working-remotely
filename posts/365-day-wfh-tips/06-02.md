Be a technology leader when it comes to providing technology that helps your people connect. Tools come and go, but there will always be technology that helps us connect in real time or asynchronously. Think about what your team needs. Video, screen sharing, document storage, and breakout rooms are all becoming table stakes. Invest in the technology to address those needs. Your team will feel a closer connection to each other and to the material they need to do their jobs.
