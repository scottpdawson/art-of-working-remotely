description: "Be the one who’s willing to catch the ball."

A lot of success, whether virtual or in person, comes from being the person who naturally takes the lead. To use a baseball analogy, it’s a pop fly in deep center field. You can be the one who yells, “Got it!” and positions themselves for the catch, or you can be the one who looks around first to see if anyone else is going to go for it. By being the one who’s willing to catch the ball, you communicate you’re a go-getter. You have initiative. You have ideas. And you’ll get invited to play the game far more often.
