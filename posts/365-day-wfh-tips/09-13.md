Other people can make a real difference in the balance you feel every day. If you find that days can go by without having an in-person social interaction with another human, take some steps to fix that. Seek out activities or events with people you’d enjoy being social with, start going, and open up and talk once you’re there. Social interactions will follow … all it takes is time and commitment.
