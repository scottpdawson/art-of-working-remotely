This is the perfect corollary to yesterday's tip. Recognize when your team is heads-down on something else, and sharing information will simply add to the noise and distract them. See, there's a time and place for sharing information, and if you get it wrong, you'll just frustrate your intended audience. Share when you need to share. When the tactical importance of what you need to share is just not clear, save it for another more appropriate time. Don't be a distraction.
