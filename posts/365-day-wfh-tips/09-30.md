When crafting an email, instant message, or any other kind of written async communication, keep this phrase in mind from the perspective of the recipient. They won’t have to think as much if you include proper context, relevant links, citations, or expectations around timing or deliverables. Clarity matters and can help reduce confusion. It’s good to get it right the first time.
