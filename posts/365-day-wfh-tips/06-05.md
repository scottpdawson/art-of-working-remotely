Did you inadvertently offend someone? Perhaps it was in the heat of the moment in a tense discussion, or a communication misunderstanding, or a gaffe where you thought you were on mute. Whatever it is, get in front of it.

Luckily, there are two magic words that can help you start any conversation like this: “I’m sorry.”
