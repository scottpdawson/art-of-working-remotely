You don’t have to do everything yourself, especially as the manager of a distributed team. If someone on your team has a penchant for something that’s on your plate, let them take the lead. If someone shows a willingness or eagerness to take on something new, give them a shot. To delegate is to empower, and empowerment feels good. Lastly, if you're struggling with something you don’t know how to do, enlist a teammate to help to do the work. But, take the time to learn from what they do.
