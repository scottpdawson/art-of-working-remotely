description: "Give the gift of focused, unbounded attention."

Think about the last time you met with someone, be they a spouse, friend, colleague, medical professional, or a service worker. Were they patient and attentive, or impatient and distracted? Did it seem like they had all the time in the world for you, or did the interaction seem rushed? When you experience the former, you feel like it’s a high-quality interaction. You trust them. When you’re the spouse, friend, colleague … anyone … give the other person the gift of your attention. Clear the mental decks, so to speak, and focus on the interaction.
