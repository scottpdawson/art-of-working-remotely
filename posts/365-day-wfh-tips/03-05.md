Sharing an office with a pet can be wonderful for all parties involved. It's nice to have a constant companion during weekdays. The stressful highs and emotional lows of your work day can be evened out by the presence of a pet, and that helps your overall morale. It's great for your pet, too. It's comforting for them to be in a shared space with another human. Pets are great icebreakers, too, even if you're virtual. It's easy to start a conversation when an animal enters the picture.
