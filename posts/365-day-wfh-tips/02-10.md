If you don't understand something, it can be incredibly powerful to ask for more information in public. If you're in a meeting, get clarification in the moment. If you have a question, someone else in the group likely has the same exact question you do but is afraid to ask it. Same goes for online forums: one of the superpowers of the Internet is that people ask questions publicly, and the answers are there for all to see.
