description: "Be aware of inclusion for meetings of hybrid teams."

When you have a conference room full of people mixed with a few remote participants, it can create a dichotomy of “people in the room” vs. “people at home”. If everyone is remotely dialed in and screen-sharing, there’s no such dichotomy and a better sense of equality and inclusion. Be aware of this as you run meetings with disparate groups of onsite and remote participants; do your best to include remote participants as readily as in-room participants.
