description: "Pronounce names properly."
---

We live and work in an international, intergenerational world. Names can be unique and sometimes it's not obvious how to pronounce them. Learn how: listen to the person introduce themselves (to you, or others), or simply ask them how to best pronounce their name. Also, learn and use the proper pronouns for those you're close with. It's important and conveys respect.
