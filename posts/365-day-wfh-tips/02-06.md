description: "Transcend your title."
---

Let's say you're in charge of producing widgets. Day in, day out, that's what you do. But one day, you have an idea to improve the design of the widgets. You tell yourself, "You're a producer, not a designer." And your idea dies right there. Transcend your title and let it live. Share it with those who need to hear it. It may go nowhere, or it may result in an evolutionary change for you. You won't know unless you share.
