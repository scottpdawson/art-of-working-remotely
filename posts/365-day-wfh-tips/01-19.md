Think working from home excuses you from truly taking time to recuperate? Think again. You might choose to work at times you feel subpar, and that's okay. Know where the line is, though. If you feel sick enough, take time to recuperate. Rest. Don't check email. Don't take calls. And don't apologize for taking care of yourself.
