description: "Put yourself first."

Few things are worth putting yourself on the line for, and work is probably not one of them. When you’re feeling stressed, burned out, or frazzled, ask yourself: am I putting myself first? When you prioritize your well-being, you will give yourself the mind space to deal with the sources of stress. Make sure you’re getting adequate sleep, exercise, and quality food. Everything else can wait.
