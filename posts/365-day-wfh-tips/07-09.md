Like a good task manager, a good note-taking app will let you sync across devices, embed images and rich text, add links to text, and efficiently search. Gone are the days of using sticky notes and placing them all over your desktop. You might enjoy the tactile feel of a real notebook, too, but will sacrifice the ability to search and backup your carefully-taken notes.
