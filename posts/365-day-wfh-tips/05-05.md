It can be difficult to have a single computer: it’s so easy to context switch between leisure and work tasks. If you have the luxury of having dedicated hardware for personal and professional work, you're already ahead of the game. It's really effective to put one to sleep - or away - when you're supposed to be working on the other. If you have a single device, it may support multiple desktops or profiles. Set up your screens based on your task flow and you’ll cut down on distractions.
