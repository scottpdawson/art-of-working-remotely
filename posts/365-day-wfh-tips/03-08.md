Who has control over what you think about? You do, of course! When you think (or visualize) that something bad might happen - like failing a test, freezing during a presentation, or flubbing a pitch - you just might increase the chances it happens. When you think positively and imagine your success, you may edge the odds in your favor. Your emotional and mental attitude is all up to you. I wrote about [my experience with thinking positively as a youth](https://scottpdawson.com/positive-mental-attitude-the-service-of-pma-the-moose/). The ordeal helped me harness mental toughness, have a positive attitude, and practice positive self-talk. Give it a try and see what happens!
