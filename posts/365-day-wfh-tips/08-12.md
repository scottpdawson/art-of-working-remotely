Don’t throw your team under the bus. The buck stops with you. I’ve seen plenty of managers face down criticism of something their team did with classic deflection. There’s always an excuse - a mitigating circumstance - but in your managerial role, you cannot go further than yourself. When reflecting on something that didn’t go quite right, think about what role you played. What could you have done differently to result in a different outcome, despite the fact that the actual blunder was caused by one of your team, or an external factor? Chances are you can identify several things that you directly influenced (or could have influenced) and can learn from them.
