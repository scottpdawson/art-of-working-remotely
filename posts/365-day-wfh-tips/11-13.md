Agree as a group on where different types of communication happen and where you persist content. Email should play only a supporting role in communication. Important documentation should never be relegated to a local hard drive. It’s far better to rely on asynchronous cloud-based approaches, since they encourage sharing, searching, and good access control. When you agree on tools and create habits using them, your team won’t ever wonder where something is documented.
