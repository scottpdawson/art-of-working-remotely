If you work in a hybrid workplace, or are the outlier in a mostly onsite company, you will be asked to travel. There is a fine line to trip frequency, though. Travel should benefit both parties. The desire for “face time” usually cuts only one way, so safeguard your time and balance travel well with your need to be at home and productive. Seeing others in real life is great — teams work well when social connections are strong. It doesn’t take much, just a few social interactions and working together in the same place for a few days. When you travel, make a point to meet people who joined the team recently.
