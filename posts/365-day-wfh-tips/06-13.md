description: "Use breaks to calm your mind."

Stepping away for a few moments during your workday? Use the time to do something that takes your mind off work-related things. Think about activities that relax you. That might be a short walk in your garden or down your street, sitting in a shady spot on a hot day, sketching or writing in a notebook, or cracking open a book that youâ€™re eager to read. The key is relaxation, leaving you fresh and ready for the rest of your day.
