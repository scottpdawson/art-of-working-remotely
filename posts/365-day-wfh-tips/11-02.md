When you're working remotely, it's easy it is to use part of a day to handle medical or dental appointments. It’s great to take care of that without having to sacrifice a whole day, or more than an hour or two. Same applies for voting. When it’s Election Day, familiarize yourself with what’s on the ballot and make a plan to vote. It’s so important, and since you work remotely, it doesn’t take a ton of time from your day.
