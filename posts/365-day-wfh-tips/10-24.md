Things rarely move as fast as you’d like. When you have to wait, recall the title of A. A. Milne’s childhood classic, “Be Patient, Pooh.” Information can make the waiting more bearable. If you’re the one waiting, master the tactful soft inquiry about status (but don’t pester). If others are waiting on you, set expectations and never leave people guessing.
