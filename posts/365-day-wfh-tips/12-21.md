Post-2020, having a decent webcam is probably a must-have in your remote work tech arsenal. Sure, you can use your built-in laptop camera, but if you have an external monitor, it might be an awkward setup. After all, who likes the upward angle of a laptop webcam when you can enjoy the straight-on angle that a monitor-mounted webcam offers? Technology evolves fast, so look to sites like nytimes.com/wirecutter for the latest recommendations. You'll find many options with sharp video, great white balance, and efficient autofocus.
