description: "Tell the truth."

There are many adages about truth, but my personal favorite is “Honesty is the best policy.” Whether you’ve made a mistake, don’t know the answer to a question, or feel like blaming someone else, tell the truth. Avoidance, evasion, and misdirection will cause you future grief. Lies build on themselves, so accept short-term pain over something far worse in the future.
