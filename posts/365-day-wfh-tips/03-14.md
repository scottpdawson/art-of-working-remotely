Technology is great. Most of the time, it does what it's supposed to as advertised, without tiring or complaint. That said, verify that it does what you expect before you need it. If you need to do a big presentation using features of a collaboration platform you've not yet tried, test it out in advance. Dry runs are your friend. Learn how it works in advance and codify it however works best for you. When you're under pressure in the moment, the learnings from your dry run will be invaluable.
