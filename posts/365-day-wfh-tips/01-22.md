One of the most important items in my remote work arsenal pivots on a trio of hinges. A door can be shut when you need privacy for an important meeting. A door signals to others that you're busy. A door can dampen noise coming from other rooms where you're working. If you have the luxury of a workspace with a door, you're in good shape.
