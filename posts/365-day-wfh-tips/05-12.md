description: "Avoid filler material."

Time is the most precious commodity you have. If you’ve exhausted the agenda of a meeting (you have one of those, right?) prior to the planned end time, simply end the meeting. There’s no need to prompt further discussion, tap dance, or provide filler material until the clock runs out. Often, this will result in the meeting running over. Instead, send everyone back to whatever they were doing. They’ll thank you for it.
