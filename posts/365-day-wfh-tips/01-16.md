This key clause of the serenity prayer can unblock so much of the angst that comes with an unpleasant situation. You may be stuck with a bad boss, a tough client, or an annoying colleague. If you accept the situation for what it is, at least for the moment, you can more readily take steps to make the situation more bearable.
