Working remotely doesnâ€™t mean you have to sit in a chair alone in your home office, day after day. Take advantages of opportunities to relocate: to another room where you live, a library, coffee shop, a coworking space, a shaded table just outside your door, or a quiet park bench. Great work can be done anywhere, and sometimes the boost you need to can be gained by a change of scenery. Plus, you may even get a little socialization in the process, which is always a good thing.
