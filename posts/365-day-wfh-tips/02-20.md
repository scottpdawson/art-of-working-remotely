Don't you love to learn more about who your coworkers are when they're not actively working? So much of in-office interaction is around our passions, our hobbies, and our families. When you're distributed, it should be no different. Show off your family, talk about your weekend plans, and share pictures and anecdotes. And what if someone else in your household makes an unplanned appearance on your video call? Don't stress about it. That's humanity, and that's definitely in bounds.
