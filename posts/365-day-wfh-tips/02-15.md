It can be easy to let major milestones slip by, with barely a glance in the rear-view mirror to pause and reflect on what led you there. When you achieve a significant goal, whether by yourself or as part of a team, make the time to celebrate your accomplishment. It may be as simple as a half-hour virtual gathering to talk about what worked, what could have gone better, and to toast your success. You and your team will come away with a solid appreciation of the work you did, and how it led to your accomplishment.
