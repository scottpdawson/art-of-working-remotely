Video calls can take a lot of energy from you. Try trading video for audio-only, especially if nobody is sharing their screen. Either turn off your camera or use the audio-only dial-in number if your meeting supports it. You can have more flexibility with an audio call and walk around, stretch, or do a light chore. You may find you’re able to pay closer attention and have a more free-flowing conversation when you’re not sitting at your desk, too.
