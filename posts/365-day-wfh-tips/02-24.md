Depending on where you work, you might not have total discretion over which task management tool to use. If you do, though, do your homework. Find a solution that works for you (and that may not be a software solution) and stick with it. Don't waste time looking for something better unless it's been at least a few years and you find yourself craving functionality that's not there. Invest time in becoming a proficient pro user, too. You'll gain time and ramp up productivity by efficiently using the tools and techniques you chose.
