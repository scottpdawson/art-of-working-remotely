You wouldn’t mount a musical or perform a play without a dress rehearsal, would you? For important meetings, get a small group of key stakeholders together. Rehearse the actual event using the same tools, applications, and talking points as the real deal. Make sure your screen resolution is good enough and that you know how to mute and unmute participants if needed. It can help to have a partner help moderate the meeting and chat while you’re doing the presenting. This practice will sharpen the focus of your delivery, work out any kinks in the technology, and get invaluable feedback. Lastly, think through the things that can go wrong and have a contingency plan.
