Ah, the collision of two adages. It's said that the definition of insanity is repeating the same steps and expecting a different result. It's also said that practice makes perfect. Sometimes, though, the path to success lies in traversing another path, approaching the problem from another angle. Step away, evaluate your approach, adjust your plan, and try again.
