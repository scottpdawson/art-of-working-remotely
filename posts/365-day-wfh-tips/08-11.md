The temperature of your workspace is one of the biggest benefits when comparing remote work to in-office work. When you’re in a space that’s not your own, you don’t have much control over this, but in your own environment, you decide when it’s too cold, too warm, or just right. You decide whether you have shoes on or off. And you decide whether the window is wide open, tightly shut, or open just enough to let in a soft breeze. Aah.
