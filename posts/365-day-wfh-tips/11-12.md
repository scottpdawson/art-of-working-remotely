It’s nice to have a window in your workspace. Natural light can elevate your mood, and it can feel good to look outside during your workday. When it’s nice out, an open window provides fresh air and ambient noise. For the best results with videoconferencing, face the natural light, or an angle from it. Never face away from it.
