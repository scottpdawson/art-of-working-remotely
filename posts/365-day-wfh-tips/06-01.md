description: "Recognize imposter syndrome for what it is."
---

Do you doubt your abilities? Does it feel difficult to accept your accomplishments as evidence of your competence? These feelings can really come to the fore when you’re not physically with others, though they can afflict anyone. To combat imposter syndrome, start by not judging yourself for having these feelings. Treat yourself with kindness and compassion. Try to examine what underlies the feelings. Perhaps they’ll reveal some things you need to change, whether it’s reframing your mindset (I’ve worked hard and I deserve to be here) or spurring you to make a change (looking for the next step in your career, finding ways to deal with stress, or being transparent with someone you trust). If it persists, find a professional therapist who can help you deal with those thoughts and feelings.
