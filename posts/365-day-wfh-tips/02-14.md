Kindness goes farther than you think. When you're not physically with others, it's harder to pick up on the non-verbals that can cue you in to a larger problem. Someone may be having a tough time at work, personal relationship stress, or another hardship. When you imbue interactions with kindness and compassion, you create a stronger platform for healing - or at least getting through the day unscathed. Turn that lens inward, too. You know when you need compassion yourself, and you're the first person that can deliver the goods.
