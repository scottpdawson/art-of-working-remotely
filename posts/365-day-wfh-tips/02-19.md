Some days are laid back. Others, crazy. The latter can feel overwhelming and unsustainable, but they're where the magic is made. When you're performing well and not letting the crazy overwhelm you, you're nailing it. Frenetic might not be fun in the moment, though, so remember that the less-crazy days will return. Yeah, it's that 'change' thing. You can count on it!
