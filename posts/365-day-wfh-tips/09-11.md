Life goes on around you every day. Lawn mowers, family members, loud pets, emergency vehicles, and delivery trucks can all impinge on an otherwise quiet day. When youâ€™re on a call, think about the effect those background noises can have on others. You can try to insulate your work locations from noise intrusion by closing windows or doors, but you might also rely on your mute button, noise-canceling earphones, or software like krisp.ai.
