description: "Be truly present."
---

Imagine you’re in a conference room with a group of people. The speaker is sitting right next to you, making eye contact and engaging with others around the table as they go through the agenda. Would you slouch in your chair, check your email, or send texts to your friends? No. Virtual is no different. When cameras are on (and sometimes when they’re off), others know whether you’re truly present.
