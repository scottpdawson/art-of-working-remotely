Lack of transparency is one reason managers might not be comfortable with remote work. They can't see you, so find ways to remove shreds of doubt about your productivity. You don't have to be a completely open book, mind you, but if you take the time to proactively communicate your status, that'll go a long way toward making the situation better.
