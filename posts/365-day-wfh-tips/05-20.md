You can subscribe to printed editions of your favorite magazines and publications, but online is far easier. Sign up for the email lists of your favorite publishers. You might consider paying for a few digital subscriptions for publications that are really important to you. Several companies offer paid subscriptions for current and back editions of many traditional magazines, but you could also check your local library: they may offer free digital magazine subscriptions as part of your membership.
