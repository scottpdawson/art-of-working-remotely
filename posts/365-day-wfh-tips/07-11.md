Refactoring, in the world of software development, is the process of improving the structure, legibility, elegance, or maintainability of your code without affecting what it does. In other words, improving the mechanics, not the message. Refactoring can apply to many domains, including emails, requirements, presentations, and designs. Take time to do your best work, and then ask yourself: is there a way I can improve it? Refactoring takes time, but can be worth it in the long run.
