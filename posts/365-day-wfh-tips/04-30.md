Networking is important. Not only can it be a source of important social and professional connection, the long-term value of a solid network can be priceless. Your network might help you blaze a career path. It might help you land a big deal. You might play a major role in helping someone else achieve their dreams. And someone you know professionally may be the one to throw you a lifeline when you need it the most.
