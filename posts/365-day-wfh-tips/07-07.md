When you’re sharing your screen with others, there are a few tips that can make things go more smoothly. Share just the application you want to, so you don’t inadvertently share something you didn’t intend. If you must share your entire screen, quit any applications like chat or email that could pop up notifications and interrupt your flow. Lastly, be aware of screen resolution. If you have a huge external monitor, sharing a window from there might not give your guests a great view. Instead, try sharing the window from your laptop’s screen, which likely has a better resolution for sharing.
