description: "Don’t equivocate when defining action."

You’ve decided as a group that you need to take action. Be clear about the next steps and who’s expected to do what. Instead of saying, “let’s do XYZ next”, "let's take that offline", or “we should talk to Bob first,” be precise, unambiguous, and assign ownership: “I’ll schedule a call with Bob. Who else needs to be there?” and “XYZ will take a few days of effort. Jake, will you take that on?”
