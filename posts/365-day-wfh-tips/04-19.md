Going to be out of the office (OOO) on a planned vacation or unexpectedly due to illness? Try your best to set your out-of-office status on email and collaboration platforms. Tell people how long you'll be out for and who they can contact in the meantime if they have questions. If you're in a role that's difficult to back up, consider listing your cell phone contact information there in case of emergency.
