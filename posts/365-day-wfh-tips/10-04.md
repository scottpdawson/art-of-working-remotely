Your team works hard. Chances are, though, those outside your team don’t know who those hard workers are. Give them a chance to promote themselves by showing their work to a broader group, taking the lead on an initiative, driving a demonstration to senior leadership, or joining a client-focused call. If that type of exposure is not something they’re comfortable with, and they would like to become more adept at it, give them professional development opportunities to cultivate their presentation skills.
