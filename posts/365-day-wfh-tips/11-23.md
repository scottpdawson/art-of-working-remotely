If you’re a solo practitioner, time tracking may be one of the very first things you set up. It’s critical for billing, but keeping track of your time may also shed light on productivity-draining habits. RescueTime has been mentioned several times in conversations with other remote workers. It tracks “time spent on applications and websites, giving you an accurate picture of your day.” Apple devices provide usage reports in Settings > Screen Time. You can set scheduled downtime, limit usage, and identify apps that take up most of your time.
