When you’re in a group leading or participating in a hybrid meeting, don’t forget those who are participating on camera. When you focus your gaze only on the others in the room with you, it can make video participants feel excluded. Look to the camera periodically to address them directly, just as you would scan the entire room if you were giving a presentation.
