description: "Check in on your team’s welfare."

Team leaders should drop in on their team members at regular intervals to simply check in. It could be done as part of a one-on-one, but also could be casually scheduled, just as if you’d bumped into each other in the office. The purpose is not to check in on work, but rather, their life. How are they doing emotionally? What non-work activities are they into? What stressors are at play for them? You, in turn, can share your own thoughts on these topics. By caring for the whole person, you demonstrate respect for them and help enhance trust in your relationship.
