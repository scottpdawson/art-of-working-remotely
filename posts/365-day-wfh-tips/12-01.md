You may be happy in your job, but what happens when you find yourself in need of a new gig? Do you have materials like a resume or portfolio to showcase your work? Donâ€™t wait until the need is urgent. Set a reminder (annually is a decent frequency) to revisit these materials and keep them up to date with your latest accomplishments. Your future self will thank you!
