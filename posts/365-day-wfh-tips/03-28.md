Are you struggling emotionally at work, or in general? Don't fear being vulnerable with others, including your direct supervisor. Sharing can help you start to overcome what you're struggling with. If you're in a supervisory role, try to cultivate a safe environment where sharing can occur organically. It'll help you forge strong bonds within your team, especially if there's no fear that sharing will have an adverse effect on one's job.
