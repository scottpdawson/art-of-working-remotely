Home offices can have the polar opposite of the design aesthetic of a traditional office with off-white walls or tan cubicle dividers. Make your space yours: start with color on the walls. Paint them with colors you enjoy. Hang things that are meaningful and inspirational: posters, paintings, maps, photos, or designs. Put things you love on your bookshelves, and orient your favorite books with the cover facing out. You’ll get to look at these wonderful things for hours each day, and some of them are bound to be conversation starters when you’re on video calls.
