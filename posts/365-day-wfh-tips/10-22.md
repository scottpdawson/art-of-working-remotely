You donâ€™t always have to wait for something tactical to be on a video call with someone else. You might enjoy the feeling of being side-by-side with someone while simply working, mimicking the energy and proximity of a real coworking space. This type of interaction can help with mono-tasking and focus. Give it a try at caveday.org or try it on your collaboration platform of choice with someone you already work with.
