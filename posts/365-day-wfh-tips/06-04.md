description: "Don’t do personal work on business networks."

Relegate your shopping, searching, and social networking to your personal devices. It can be tempting to use your work computer to look up a great dinner place for later, check your personal email, do some online shopping on Cyber Monday, or mindlessly scroll through social media on your lunch break. Don’t do it, though. Your business’s network is for business, and when you conduct personal work there, you’re both being surveilled (potentially) by your employer (opening you to scrutiny) and unnecessarily opening the network up to security vulnerabilities.
