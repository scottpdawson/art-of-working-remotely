I started #RemoteChat 5 years ago, and December 15, 2021 marks the 250th episode. I’m big into numbers, and 250 chats over 5 years has a nice ring to it. At the same time, I have several other priorities that need to step into the light, so I’ve made the tough decision to stop hosting #RemoteChat after that 250th episode. It's hard to believe it's been 5 years! It all started with a spark of an idea to create a community, and this was the very first tweet using the **#wfhchat** hashtag:

{% tweet "804023693198303232" %}

Since then, I've asked 1,500 questions, changed from **#wfhchat** to **#RemoteChat** to be more inclusive _(we all don't work from home, you know?)_, met hundreds of fantastic people, [published a book](/book/), and learned a _lot_ about myself. I truly hope to see you there for the last few chats of this year, culminating with one last round of questions on December 15. If you feel like this chat should continue under someone else's stewardship, I'm totally open to that: [contact me](/contact/) and we can certainly talk about it!

Please, [let's keep in touch](https://twitter.com/scottpdawson). It's been a fantastic ride.
