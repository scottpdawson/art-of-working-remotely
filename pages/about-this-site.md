Hello. I'm Scott Dawson. I’ve worked remotely, from my home office, since 1998. I worked the first fifteen years remotely at a Fortune 100 company and most recently at a Fortune 500 company, both in New York City.

I live and work 5 hours outside of New York City in a small town outside of Ithaca. I’ve built a custom home there, live a fit lifestyle and have raised two wonderful children with my wife. I classify myself as a web designer and developer, but even more so as a really effective remote employee. When I tell people about my situation, they usually say they could never work remotely; that it would take too much discipline. Then the intriguing questions start:

> _How do you stay motivated?_
> 
> _How do you stay connected?_
> 
> _How do you avoid staying “out of sight and out of mind”?_

I’ve answered these questions, and many more, for friends and colleagues who are interested in starting to work remotely. Most recently, one of my colleagues asked me for some tips in a very poignant instant messaging thread. He was a new father at the time, and had just started off working remotely. He was struggling, and it was clear to me after a few messages that he wasn’t venting about the traditional distractions of housework and proximity to a full pantry. That messaging thread turned out to be the catalyst for me to start writing this book. He was having a lot of trouble ignoring the distractions around him. He needed help.

I started writing with the goal of completing a book, and also started a [#RemoteChat](/remotechat/) on Twitter. I hope you find this site useful and engaging, and I look forward to connecting with you at one of the weekly chats! If you want to learn a bit more about me, I have a personal web site at [scottpdawson.com](https://scottpdawson.com) and you can find me on Twitter [@scottpdawson](https://twitter.com/scottpdawson).
