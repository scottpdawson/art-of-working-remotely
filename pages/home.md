Whether you’ve been working remotely for many years, or are just starting out, you’ve realized that remote work can look very different. It depends on where you’re working. What you’re working on. Who you’re working for, and who you’re working with. It depends on where you live, and whether you’re on your own or living with a bunch of other people. As you put your time in as a remote worker, you’ll invariably realize ...

> “Hey, there’s an **art** to this working remotely thing.”

I’ve worked remotely since 1998, and I realized that I have a lot to share so others wouldn’t have to learn the hard lessons (per se). We all have a lot to share. **So let’s do that.**

First, you should totally jump into one of the weekly [#RemoteChat](/remotechat/) Twitter sessions. They’re a lot of fun, and a great way to meet other people who also work remotely. Twitter not your thing? No problem. There’s plenty to see on this site, and if you get FOMO from time to time, just [subscribe to get updates](http://eepurl.com/dw045L). Next, roll up your sleeves and check out one of the many [topical pages about remote work](/topics/) on this site.

**Thanks for stopping by.** Enjoy the site. Read [The Art of Working Remotely](/book). Enjoy [#RemoteChat](/remotechat/). And most importantly, enjoy everything that working remotely can offer you. It’s a great way to live and work!
