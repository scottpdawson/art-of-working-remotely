**Programming Note**: December 15, 2021 marks [the last #RemoteChat](/news/the-end-of-the-remotechat-journey/). It's been a wonderful 5 year journey!

Do you work remotely? #RemoteChat is a weekly Twitter chat for remote workers. There's a solid group of frequent chatters and it's a great way to get to know remote workers from all over the world!

## How do you #RemoteChat? It's easy!

1. Log into Twitter at 1p EST (6p UTC) each Wednesday
2. Look for the [#RemoteChat](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RemoteChat) tag
3. Answer 6 questions over the course of the hour. For Q1, start your tweet with A1 and use the #RemoteChat hashtag
4. Enjoy interacting with others!

_**Hint:**_ You might find that using a client like [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) is a great way to keep track of the conversation. It can be done on mobile Twitter clients, too, but the extra space on a desktop is nice!
